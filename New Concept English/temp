we
can
read
of
things
that
happened
years
ago
in
the
near
east
where
people
first
learned
to
write
but
there
are
some
parts
of
the
world
where
even
now
people
cannot
write
the
only
way
that
they
can
preserve
their
history
is
to
recount
it
as
sagas
legends
handed
down
from
one
generation
of
story
tellers
to
another
these
legends
are
useful
because
they
can
tell
us
something
about
migrations
of
people
who
lived
long
ago
but
none
could
write
down
what
they
did
anthropologists
wondered
where
the
remote
ancestors
of
the
polynesian
peoples
now
living
in
the
pacific
islands
came
from
the
sagas
of
these
people
explain
that
some
of
them
came
from
indonesia
about
years
ago
but
the
first
people
who
were
like
ourselves
lived
so
long
ago
that
even
their
sagas
if
they
had
any
are
forgotten
so
archaeologists
have
neither
history
nor
legends
to
help
them
to
find
out
where
the
first
modern
men
came
from
fortunately
however
ancient
men
made
tools
of
stone
especially
flint
because
this
is
easier
to
shape
than
other
kinds
they
may
also
have
used
wood
and
skins
but
these
have
rotted
away
stone
does
not
decay
and
so
the
tools
of
long
ago
have
remained
when
even
the
bones
of
the
men
who
made
them
have
disappeared
without
trace
why
you
may
wonder
should
spiders
be
our
friends
because
they
destroy
so
many
insects
and
insects
include
some
of
the
greatest
enemies
of
the
human
race
insects
would
make
it
impossible
for
us
to
live
in
the
world
they
would
devour
all
our
crops
and
kill
our
flocks
and
herds
if
it
were
not
for
the
protection
we
get
from
insect
eating
animals
we
owe
a
lot
to
the
birds
and
beasts
who
eat
insects
but
all
of
them
put
together
kill
only
a
fraction
of
the
number
destroyed
by
spiders
moreover
unlike
some
of
the
other
insect
eaters
spiders
never
do
the
least
harm
to
us
or
our
belongings
spiders
are
not
insects
as
many
people
think
nor
even
nearly
related
to
them
one
can
tell
the
difference
almost
at
a
glance
for
a
spider
always
has
eight
legs
and
an
insect
never
more
than
six
how
many
spiders
are
engaged
in
this
work
on
our
behalf
one
authority
on
spiders
made
a
census
of
the
spiders
in
a
grass
field
in
the
south
of
england
and
he
estimated
that
there
were
more
than
in
one
acre
that
is
something
like
spiders
of
different
kinds
on
a
football
pitch
spiders
are
busy
for
at
least
half
the
year
in
killing
insects
it
is
impossible
to
make
more
than
the
wildest
guess
at
how
many
they
kill
but
they
are
hungry
creatures
not
content
with
only
three
meals
a
day
it
has
been
estimated
that
the
weight
of
all
the
insects
destroyed
by
spiders
in
britain
in
one
year
would
be
greater
than
the
total
weight
of
all
the
human
beings
in
the
country
modern
alpinists
try
to
climb
mountains
by
a
route
which
will
give
them
good
sport
and
the
more
difficult
it
is
the
more
highly
it
is
regarded
in
the
pioneering
days
however
this
was
not
the
case
at
all
the
early
climbers
were
looking
for
the
easiest
way
to
the
top
because
the
summit
was
the
prize
they
sought
especially
if
it
had
never
been
attained
before
it
is
true
that
during
their
explorations
they
often
faced
difficulties
and
dangers
of
the
most
perilous
nature
equipped
in
a
manner
which
would
make
a
modern
climber
shudder
at
the
thought
but
they
did
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
court
such
excitement
they
had
a
single
aim
a
solitary
goal
the
top
it
is
hard
for
us
to
realize
nowadays
how
difficult
it
was
for
the
pioneers
except
for
one
or
two
places
such
as
zermatt
and
chamonix
which
had
rapidly
become
popular
alpine
villages
tended
to
be
impoverished
settlements
cut
off
from
civilization
by
the
high
mountains
such
inns
as
there
were
were
generally
dirty
and
flea
ridden
the
food
simply
local
cheese
accompanied
by
bread
often
twelve
months
old
all
washed
down
with
coarse
wine
often
a
valley
boasted
no
inn
at
all
and
climbers
found
shelter
wherever
they
could
sometimes
with
the
local
priest
who
was
usually
as
poor
as
his
parishioners
sometimes
with
shepherds
or
cheese
makers
invariably
the
background
was
the
same
dirt
and
poverty
and
very
uncomfortable
for
men
accustomed
to
eating
seven
course
dinners
and
sleeping
between
fine
linen
sheets
at
home
the
change
to
the
alpsmust
have
been
very
hard
indeed
in
the
soviet
union
several
cases
have
been
reported
recently
of
people
who
can
read
and
detect
colours
with
their
fingers
and
even
see
through
solid
doors
and
walls
one
case
concerns
an
eleven
year
old
schoolgirl
vera
petrova
who
has
normal
vision
but
who
can
also
perceive
things
with
different
parts
of
her
skin
and
through
solid
walls
this
ability
was
first
noticed
by
her
father
one
day
she
came
into
his
office
and
happened
to
put
her
hands
on
the
door
of
a
locked
safe
suddenly
she
asked
her
father
why
he
kept
so
many
old
newspapers
locked
away
there
and
even
described
the
way
they
were
done
up
in
bundles
vera
s
curious
talent
was
brought
to
the
notice
of
a
scientific
research
institute
in
the
town
of
uiyanovsk
near
where
she
lives
and
in
april
she
was
given
a
series
of
tests
by
a
special
commission
of
the
ministry
of
health
of
the
russian
federal
republic
during
these
tests
she
was
able
to
read
a
newspaper
through
an
opaque
screen
and
stranger
still
by
moving
her
elbow
over
a
child
s
game
of
lotto
she
was
able
to
describe
the
figures
and
colours
printed
on
it
and
in
another
instance
wearing
stockings
and
slippers
to
make
out
with
her
foot
the
outlines
and
colours
of
a
picture
hidden
under
a
carpet
other
experiments
showed
that
her
knees
and
shoulders
had
a
similar
sensitivity
during
all
these
tests
vera
was
blindfold
and
indeed
except
when
blindfold
she
lacked
the
ability
to
perceive
things
with
her
skin
it
was
also
found
that
although
she
could
perceive
things
with
her
fingers
this
ability
ceased
the
moment
her
hands
were
wet
the
gorilla
is
something
of
a
paradox
in
the
african
scene
one
thinks
one
knows
him
very
well
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
he
has
been
killed
captured
and
imprisoned
in
zoos
his
bones
have
been
mounted
in
natural
history
museums
everywhere
and
he
has
always
exerted
a
strong
fascination
upon
scientists
and
romantics
alike
he
is
the
stereotyped
monster
of
the
horror
films
and
the
adventure
books
and
an
obvious
though
not
perhaps
strictly
scientific
linkwith
our
ancestral
past
yet
the
fact
is
we
know
very
little
about
gorillas
no
really
satisfactory
photograph
has
ever
been
taken
of
one
in
a
wild
state
no
zoologist
however
intrepid
has
been
able
to
keep
the
animal
under
close
and
constant
observation
in
the
dark
jungles
in
which
he
lives
carl
akeley
the
american
naturalist
led
two
expeditions
in
the
nineteen
twenties
and
now
lies
buried
among
the
animals
heloved
so
well
but
even
he
was
unable
to
discover
how
long
the
gorilla
lives
or
how
or
why
it
dies
nor
was
he
able
to
define
the
exact
social
pattern
of
the
family
groups
or
indicate
the
final
extent
of
their
intelligence
all
this
and
many
other
things
remain
almost
as
much
a
mystery
as
they
were
when
the
french
explorer
du
chaillu
first
described
the
animal
to
the
civilized
world
a
century
ago
the
abominable
snowman
who
haunts
the
imagination
of
climbers
in
the
himalayas
is
hardly
more
elusive
people
are
always
talking
about
the
problem
of
youth
if
there
is
one
which
i
take
leave
to
doubt
then
it
is
older
people
who
create
it
not
the
young
themselves
let
us
get
down
to
fundamentals
and
agree
that
the
young
are
after
all
human
beings
people
just
like
their
elders
there
is
only
one
difference
between
an
old
man
and
a
young
one
the
young
man
has
a
glorious
future
before
him
and
the
old
one
has
a
splendid
future
behind
him
and
maybe
that
is
where
the
rub
is
when
i
was
a
teenager
i
felt
that
i
was
just
young
and
uncertain
that
i
was
a
new
boy
in
a
huge
school
and
i
would
have
been
very
pleased
to
be
regarded
as
something
so
interesting
as
a
problem
for
one
thing
being
a
problem
gives
you
a
certain
identity
and
that
is
one
of
the
things
the
young
are
busily
engaged
in
seeking
i
find
young
people
exciting
they
have
an
air
of
freedom
and
they
have
not
a
dreary
commitment
to
mean
ambitions
or
love
of
comfort
they
are
not
anxious
social
climbers
and
they
have
no
devotion
to
material
things
all
this
seems
to
me
to
link
them
with
life
and
the
origins
of
things
it
s
as
if
they
were
in
some
sense
cosmic
beings
in
violent
an
lovely
contrast
with
us
suburban
creatures
all
that
is
in
my
mind
when
i
meet
a
young
person
he
may
be
conceited
ill
mannered
presumptuous
of
fatuous
but
i
do
not
turn
for
protection
to
dreary
cliches
about
respect
for
elders
as
if
mere
age
were
a
reason
for
respect
i
accept
that
we
are
equals
and
i
will
argue
with
him
as
an
equal
if
i
think
he
is
wrong
i
am
always
amazed
when
i
hear
people
saying
that
sport
creates
goodwill
between
the
nations
and
that
if
only
the
common
peoples
of
the
world
could
meet
one
another
at
football
or
cricket
they
would
have
no
inclination
to
meet
on
the
battlefield
even
if
one
didn
t
know
from
concrete
examples
the
olympic
games
for
instance
that
international
sporting
contests
lead
to
orgies
of
hatred
one
could
deduce
it
from
general
principles
nearly
all
the
sports
practised
nowadays
are
competitive
you
play
to
win
and
the
game
has
little
meaning
unless
you
do
your
utmost
to
win
on
the
village
green
where
you
pick
up
sides
and
no
feeling
of
local
patriotism
is
involved
it
is
possible
to
play
simply
for
the
fun
and
exercise
but
as
soon
as
the
question
of
prestige
arises
as
soon
as
you
feel
that
you
and
some
larger
unit
will
be
disgraced
if
you
lose
the
most
savage
combative
instincts
are
aroused
anyone
who
has
played
even
in
a
school
football
match
knows
this
at
the
international
level
sport
is
frankly
mimic
warfare
but
the
significant
thing
is
not
the
behaviour
of
the
players
but
the
attitude
of
the
spectators
and
behind
the
spectators
of
the
nations
who
work
themselves
into
furies
over
these
absurd
contests
and
seriously
believe
at
any
rate
for
short
periods
that
running
jumping
and
kicking
a
ball
are
tests
of
national
virtue
parents
have
to
do
much
less
for
their
children
today
than
they
used
to
do
and
home
has
become
much
less
of
a
workshop
clothes
can
be
bought
ready
made
washing
can
go
to
the
laundry
food
can
be
bought
cooked
canned
or
preserved
bread
is
baked
and
delivered
by
the
baker
milk
arrives
on
the
doorstep
meals
can
be
had
at
the
restaurant
the
works
canteen
and
the
school
dining
room
it
is
unusual
now
for
father
to
pursue
his
trade
or
other
employment
at
home
and
his
children
rarely
if
ever
see
him
at
his
place
of
work
boys
are
therefore
seldom
trained
to
follow
their
father
s
occupation
and
in
many
towns
they
have
a
fairly
wide
choice
of
employment
and
so
do
girls
the
young
wage
earner
often
earns
good
money
and
soon
acquires
a
feeling
of
economic
independence
in
textile
areas
it
has
long
been
customary
for
mothers
to
go
out
to
work
but
thispractice
has
become
so
widespread
that
the
working
mother
is
now
a
not
unusual
factor
in
a
child
s
home
life
the
number
of
married
women
in
employment
having
more
than
doubled
in
the
last
twenty
five
years
with
mother
earning
and
his
older
children
drawing
substantial
wages
father
is
seldom
the
dominant
figure
that
he
still
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
when
mother
workseconomic
advantages
accrue
but
children
lose
something
of
great
value
if
mother
s
employment
prevents
her
from
being
home
to
greet
them
when
they
return
from
school
not
all
sounds
made
by
animals
serve
as
language
and
we
have
only
to
turn
to
that
extraordinary
discovery
of
echo
location
in
bats
to
see
a
case
in
which
the
voice
plays
a
strictly
utilitarian
role
to
get
a
full
appreciation
of
what
this
means
we
must
turn
first
to
some
recent
human
inventions
everyone
knows
that
if
he
shouts
in
the
vicinity
of
a
wall
or
a
mountainside
an
echo
will
come
back
the
further
off
this
solid
obstruction
the
longer
time
will
elapse
for
the
return
of
the
echo
a
sound
made
by
tapping
on
the
hull
of
a
ship
will
be
reflected
from
the
sea
bottom
and
by
measuring
the
time
interval
between
the
taps
and
the
receipt
of
the
echoes
the
depth
of
the
sea
at
that
point
can
be
calculated
so
was
born
the
echo
sounding
apparatus
now
in
general
use
in
ships
every
solid
object
will
reflect
a
sound
varying
ac
cording
to
the
size
and
nature
of
the
object
a
shoal
of
fish
will
do
this
so
it
is
a
comparatively
simple
step
from
locating
the
sea
bottom
to
locating
a
shoal
of
fish
with
experience
and
with
improved
apparatus
it
is
now
possible
not
only
to
locate
a
shoal
but
to
tell
if
it
is
herring
cod
or
other
well
known
fish
by
the
pattern
of
its
echo
a
few
years
ago
it
was
found
that
certain
bats
emit
squeaks
and
by
receiving
the
echoes
they
could
locate
and
steer
clear
of
obstacles
or
locate
flying
insects
on
which
they
feed
this
echo
location
in
bats
is
often
compared
with
radar
the
principle
of
which
is
similar
in
our
new
society
there
is
a
growing
dislike
of
original
creative
men
the
manipulated
do
not
understand
them
the
manipulators
fear
them
the
tidy
committee
men
regard
them
with
horror
knowing
that
no
pigeonholes
can
be
found
for
them
we
could
do
with
a
few
original
creative
men
in
our
political
life
if
only
to
create
some
enthusiasm
release
some
energy
but
where
are
they
we
are
asked
to
choose
between
various
shades
of
the
negative
the
engine
is
falling
to
pieces
while
the
joint
owners
of
the
car
argue
whether
the
footbrake
or
the
handbrake
should
be
applied
notice
how
the
cold
colourless
men
without
ideas
and
with
no
other
passion
but
a
craving
for
success
get
on
in
this
society
capturing
one
plum
after
another
and
taking
the
juice
and
taste
out
of
them
sometimes
you
might
think
the
machines
we
worship
make
all
the
chief
appointments
promoting
the
human
beings
who
seem
closest
to
them
between
mid
night
and
dawn
when
sleep
will
not
come
and
all
the
old
wounds
begin
to
ache
i
often
have
a
nightmare
vision
of
a
future
world
in
which
there
are
billions
of
people
all
numbered
and
registered
with
not
a
gleam
of
genius
anywhere
not
an
original
mind
a
rich
personality
on
the
whole
packed
globe
the
twin
ideals
of
our
time
organization
and
quantity
will
have
won
for
ever
alfred
the
great
acted
as
his
own
spy
visiting
danish
camps
disguised
as
a
minstrel
in
those
days
wandering
minstrels
were
welcome
everywhere
they
were
not
fighting
men
and
their
harp
was
their
passport
alfred
had
learned
many
of
their
ballads
in
his
youth
and
could
vary
his
programme
with
acrobatic
tricks
and
simple
conjuring
while
alfred
s
little
army
slowly
began
to
gather
at
athelney
the
king
himself
set
out
to
penetrate
the
camp
of
guthrum
the
commander
of
the
danish
invaders
these
had
settled
down
for
the
winter
at
chippenham
thither
alfred
went
he
noticed
at
once
that
discipline
was
slack
the
danes
had
the
self
confidence
of
conquerors
and
their
security
precautions
were
casual
they
lived
well
on
the
proceeds
of
raids
on
neighbouring

there
they
collected
women
as
well
as
food
and
drink
and
a
life
of
ease
had
made
them
soft
alfred
stayed
in
the
camp
a
week
before
he
returned
to
athelney
the
force
there
assembled
was
trivial
compared
with
the
danish
horde
but
alfred
had
deduced
that
the
danes
were
no
longer
fit
for
prolonged
battle
and
that
their
commissariat
had
no
organization
but
depended
on
irregular
raids
so
faced
with
the
danish
advance
alfred
did
not
risk
open
battle
but
harried
the
enemy
he
was
constantly
on
the
move
drawing
the
danes
after
him
his
patrols
halted
the
raiding
parties
hunger
assailed
the
danish
army
now
alfred
began
a
long
series
of
skirmishes
and
within
a
month
the
danes
had
surrendered
the
episode
could
reasonably
serve
as
a
unique
epic
of
royal
espionage
what
characterizes
almost
all
hollywood
pictures
is
their
inner
emptiness
this
is
compensated
for
by
an
outer
impressiveness
such
impressiveness
usually
takes
the
form
of
truly
grandiose
realism
nothing
is
spared
to
make
the
setting
the
costumes
all
of
the
surface
details
correct
these
efforts
help
to
mask
the
essential
emptiness
of
the
characterization
and
the
absurdities
and
trivialities
of
the
plots
the
houses
look
like
houses
the
streets
look
like
streets
the
people
look
and
talk
like
people
but
they
are
empty
of
humanity
credibility
and
motivation
needless
to
say
the
disgraceful
censorship
code
is
an
important
factor
in
predetermining
the
content
of
these
pictures
but
the
code
does
not
disturb
the
profits
nor
the
entertainment
value
of
the
films
it
merely
helps
to
prevent
them
from
being
credible
it
isn
t
too
heavy
a
burden
for
the
industry
to
bear
in
addition
to
the
impressiveness
of
the
settings
there
is
a
use
of
the
camera
which
at
times
seems
magical
but
of
what
human
import
is
all
this
skill
all
this
effort
all
this
energy
in
the
production
of
effects
when
the
story
the
representation
of
life
is
hollow
stupid
banal
childish
oxford
has
been
ruined
by
the
motor
industry
the
peace
which
oxford
once
knew
and
which
a
great
university
city
should
always
have
has
been
swept
ruthlessly
away
and
no
benefactions
and
research
endowments
can
make
up
for
the
change
in
character
which
the
city
has
suffered
at
six
in
the
morning
the
old
courts
shake
to
the
roar
of
buses
taking
the
next
shift
to
cowley
and
pressed
steel
great
lorries
with
a
double
deck
cargo
of
cars
for
export
lumber
past
magdalen
and
the
university
church
loads
of
motor
engines
are
hurried
hither
and
thither
and
the
streets
are
thronged
with
a
population
which
has
no
interest
in
learning
and
knows
no
studies
beyond
servo
systems
and
distributors
compression
ratios
and
camshafts
theoretically
the
marriage
of
an
old
seat
of
learning
and
tradition
with
a
new
and
wealthy
industry
might
be
expected
to
produce
some
interesting
children
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
culture
of
the
university
would
radiate
out
and
transform
the
lives
of
the
workers
that
this
has
not
happened
may
be
the
fault
of
the
university
for
at
both
oxford
and
cambridge
the
colleges
tend
tolive
in
an
era
which
is
certainly
not
of
the
twentieth
century
and
upon
a
planet
which
bears
little
resemblance
to
the
war
torn
earth
wherever
the
fault
may
lie
the
fact
remains
that
it
is
the
theatre
at
oxford
and
not
at
cambridge
which
is
on
the
verge
of
extinction
and
the
only
fruit
of
the
combination
of
industry
and
the
rarefied
atmosphere
of
learning
is
the
dust
in
the
streets
and
a
pathetic
sense
of
being
lost
which
hangs
over
some
of
the
colleges
some
old
people
are
oppressed
by
the
fear
of
death
in
the
young
there
is
a
justification
for
this
feeling
young
men
who
have
reason
to
fear
that
they
will
be
killed
in
battle
may
justifiably
feel
bitter
in
the
thought
that
they
have
been
cheated
of
the
best
things
that
life
has
to
offer
but
in
an
old
man
who
has
known
human
joys
and
sorrows
and
has
achieved
whatever
work
it
was
in
him
to
do
the
fear
of
death
is
somewhat
abject
and
ignoble
the
best
way
to
overcome
it
so
at
least
it
seems
to
me
is
to
make
your
interests
gradually
wider
and
more
impersonal
until
bit
by
bit
the
walls
of
the
ego
recede
and
your
life
becomes
increasingly
merged
in
the
universal
life
an
individual
human
existence
should
be
like
a
river
small
at
first
narrowly
contained
within
its
banks
and
rushing
passionately
past
boulders
and
over
waterfalls
gradually
the
river
grows
wider
the
banks
recede
the
waters
flow
more
quietly
and
in
the
end
without
any
visible
break
they
become
merged
in
the
sea
and
painlessly
lose
their
individual
being
the
man
who
in
old
age
can
see
his
life
in
this
way
will
not
suffer
from
the
fear
of
death
since
the
things
he
cares
for
will
continue
and
it
with
the
decay
of
vitality
weariness
increases
the
thought
of
rest
will
be
not
unwelcome
i
should
wish
to
die
while
still
at
work
knowing
that
others
will
carry
on
what
i
can
no
longer
do
and
content
in
the
thought
that
what
was
possible
has
been
done
when
anyone
opens
a
current
account
at
a
bank
he
is
lending
the
bank
money
repayment
of
which
he
may
demand
at
any
time
either
in
cash
or
by
drawing
a
cheque
in
favour
of
another
person
primarily
the
banker
customer
relationship
is
that
of
debtor
and
creditor
who
is
which
depending
on
whether
the
customer
s
account
is
in
credit
or
is
overdrawn
but
in
addition
to
that
basically
simple
concept
the
bank
and
its
customer
owe
a
large
number
of
obligations
to
one
another
many
of
these
obligations
can
give
rise
to
problems
and
complications
but
a
bank
customer
unlike
say
a
buyer
of
goods
cannot
complain
that
the
law
is
loaded
against
him
the
bank
must
obey
its
customer
s
instructions
and
not
those
of
anyone
else
when
for
example
a
customer
first
opens
an
account
he
instructs
the
bank
to
debit
his
account
only
in
respect
of
cheques
drawn
by
himself
he
gives
the
bank
specimens
of
his
signature
and
there
is
a
very
firm
rule
that
the
bank
has
no
right
or
authority
to
pay
out
a
customer
s
money
on
a
cheque
on
which
its
customer
s
signature
has
been
forged
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
forgery
may
have
been
a
very
skilful
one
the
bank
must
recognize
its
customer
s
signature
for
this
reason
there
is
no
risk
to
the
customer
in
the
modern
practice
adopted
by
some
banks
of
printing
the
customer
s
name
on
his
cheques
if
this
facilitates
forgery
it
is
the
bank
which
will
lose
not
the
customer
the
deepest
holes
of
all
are
made
for
oil
and
they
go
down
to
as
much
as
feet
but
we
do
not
need
to
send
men
down
to
get
the
oil
out
as
we
must
with
other
mineral
deposits
the
holes
are
only
borings
less
than
a
foot
in
diameter
my
particular
experience
is
largely
in
oil
and
the
search
for
oil
has
done
more
to
improve
deep
drilling
than
any
other
mining
activity
when
it
has
been
decided
where
we
are
going
to
drill
we
put
up
at
the
surface
an
oil
derrick
it
has
to
be
tall
because
it
is
like
a
giant
block
and
tackle
and
we
have
to
lower
into
the
ground
and
haul
out
of
the
ground
great
lengths
of
drill
pipe
which
are
rotated
by
an
engine
at
the
top
and
are
fitted
with
a
cutting
bit
at
the
bottom
the
geologist
needs
to
know
what
rocks
the
drill
has
reached
so
every
so
often
a
sample
is
obtained
with
a
coring
bit
it
cuts
a
clean
cylinder
of
rock
from
which
can
be
seen
he
strata
the
drill
has
been
cutting
through
once
we
get
down
to
the
oil
it
usually
flows
to
the
surface
because
great
pressure
either
from
gas
or
water
is
pushing
it
this
pressure
must
be
under
control
and
we
control
it
by
means
of
the
mud
which
we
circulate
down
the
drill
pipe
we
endeavour
to
avoid
the
old
romantic
idea
of
a
gusher
which
wastes
oil
and
gas
we
want
it
to
stay
down
the
hole
until
we
can
lead
it
off
in
a
controlled
manner
the
fact
that
we
are
not
sure
what
intelligence
is
nor
what
is
passed
on
does
not
prevent
us
from
finding
it
a
very
useful
working
concept
and
placing
a
certain
amount
of
reliance
on
tests
which
measure
it
in
an
intelligence
test
we
take
a
sample
of
an
individual
s
ability
to
solve
puzzles
and
problems
of
various
kinds
and
if
we
have
taken
a
representative
sample
it
will
allow
us
to
predict
successfully
the
level
of
performance
he
will
reach
in
a
wide
variety
of
occupations
this
became
of
particular
importance
when
as
a
result
of
the
education
act
secondary
schooling
for
all
became
law
and
grammar
schools
with
the
exception
of
a
small
number
of
independent
foundation
schools
became
available
to
the
whole
population
since
the
number
of
grammar
schools
in
the
country
could
accommodate
at
most
approximately
per
cent
of
the
total
child
population
of
eleven
plus
some
kind
of
selection
had
to
be
made
narrowly
academic
examinations
and
tests
were
felt
quite
rightly
to
be
heavily
weighted
in
favour
of
children
who
had
had
the
advantage
of
highly
academic
primary
schools
and
academically
biased
homes
intelligence
tests
were
devised
to
counteract
this
narrow
specialization
by
introducing
problems
which
were
not
based
on
specifically
scholastically
acquired
knowledge
the
intelligence
test
is
an
attempt
to
assess
the
general
ability
of
any
child
to
think
reason
judge
analyse
and
synthesize
by
presenting
him
with
situations
both
verbal
and
practical
which
are
within
his
range
of
competence
and
understanding
two
factors
weigh
heavily
against
the
effectiveness
of
scientific
in
industry
one
is
the
general
atmosphere
of
secrecy
in
which
it
is
carried
out
the
other
the
lack
of
freedom
of
the
individual
research
worker
in
so
far
as
any
inquiry
is
a
secret
one
it
naturally
limits
all
those
engaged
in
carrying
it
out
from
effective
contact
with
their
fellow
scientists
either
in
other
countries
or
in
universities
or
even
often
enough
in
other
departments
of
the
same
firm
the
degree
of
secrecy
naturally
varies
considerably
some
of
the
bigger
firms
are
engaged
in
researches
which
are
of
such
general
and
fundamental
nature
that
it
is
a
positive
advantage
to
them
not
to
keep
them
secret
yet
a
great
many
processes
depending
on
such
research
are
sought
for
with
complete
secrecy
until
the
stage
at
which
patents
can
be
taken
out
even
more
processes
are
never
patented
at
all
but
kept
as
secret
processes
this
applies
particularly
to
chemical
industries
where
chance
discoveries
play
a
much
larger
part
than
they
do
in
physical
and
mechanical
industries
sometimes
the
secrecy
goes
to
such
an
extent
that
the
whole
nature
of
the
research
cannot
be
mentioned
many
firms
for
instance
have
great
difficulty
in
obtaining
technical
or
scientific
books
from
libraries
because
they
are
unwilling
to
have
their
names
entered
as
having
taken
out
such
and
such
a
book
for
fear
the
agents
of
other
firms
should
be
able
to
trace
the
kind
of
research
they
are
likely
to
be
undertaking
a
gentleman
is
rather
than
does
he
is
interested
in
nothing
in
a
professional
way
he
is
allowed
to
cultivate
hobbies
even
eccentricities
but
must
not
practise
a
vocation
he
must
know
how
to
ride
and
shoot
and
cast
a
fly
he
should
have
relatives
in
the
army
and
navy
and
at
least
one
connection
in
the
diplomatic
service
but
there
are
weaknesses
in
the
english
gentleman
s
ability
to
rule
us
today
he
usually
knows
nothing
of
political
economy
and
less
about
how
foreign
countries
are
governed
he
does
not
respect
learning
and
prefers
sport
the
problem
set
for
society
is
not
the
virtues
of
the
type
so
much
as
its
adequacy
for
its
function
and
here
grave
difficulties
arise
he
refuses
to
consider
sufficiently
the
wants
of
the
customer
who
must
buy
not
the
thing
he
desires
but
the
thing
the
english
gentleman
wants
to
sell
he
attends
inadequately
to
technological
development
disbelieving
in
the
necessity
of
large
scale
production
in
the
modern
world
he
is
passionately
devoted
to
excessive
secrecy
both
in
finance
and
method
of
production
he
has
an
incurable
and
widespread
nepotism
in
appointment
discounting
ability
and
relying
upon
a
mystic
entity
called
character
which
means
in
a
gentleman
s
mouth
the
qualities
he
traditionally
possesses
himself
his
lack
of
imagination
and
the
narrowness
of
his
social
loyalties
have
ranged
against
him
one
of
the
fundamental
estates
of
the
realm
he
is
incapable
of
that
imaginative
realism
which
admits
that
this
is
a
new
world
to
which
he
must
adjust
himself
and
his
institutions
that
every
privilege
he
formerly
took
as
of
right
he
can
now
attain
only
by
offering
proof
that
it
is
directly
relevant
to
social
welfare
in
the
organization
of
industrial
life
the
influence
of
the
factory
upon
the
physiological
and
mental
state
of
the
workers
has
been
completely
neglected
modern
industry
is
based
on
the
conception
of
the
maximum
production
at
lowest
cost
in
order
that
an
individual
or
a
group
of
individuals
may
earn
as
much
money
as
possible
it
has
expanded
without
any
idea
of
the
true
nature
of
the
human
beings
who
run
the
machines
and
without
giving
any
consideration
to
the
effects
produced
on
the
individuals
and
on
their
descendants
by
the
artificial
mode
of
existence
imposed
by
the
factory
the
great
cities
have
been
built
with
no
regard
for
us
the
shape
and
dimensions
of
the
skyscrapers
depend
entirely
on
the
necessity
of
obtaining
the
maximum
income
per
square
foot
of
ground
and
of
offering
to
the
tenants
offices
and
apartments
that
please
them
this
caused
the
construction
of
gigantic
buildings
where
too
large
masses
of
human
beings
are
crowded
together
civilized
men
like
such
a
way
of
living
while
they
enjoy
the
comfort
and
banal
luxury
of
their
dwelling
they
do
not
realize
that
they
are
deprived
of
the
necessities
of
life
the
modern
city
consists
of
monstrous
edifices
and
of
dark
narrow
streets
full
of
petrol
fumes
coal
dust
and
toxic
gases
torn
by
the
noise
of
the
taxi
cabs
lorries
and
buses
and
thronged
ceaselessly
by
great
crowds
obviously
it
has
no
been
planned
for
the
good
of
its
inhabitants
in
the
early
days
of
the
settlement
of
australia
enterprising
settlers
unwisely
introduced
the
european
rabbit
this
rabbit
had
no
natural
enemies
in
the
antipodes
so
that
it
multiplied
with
that
promiscuous
abandon
characteristic
of
rabbits
it
overran
a
whole
continent
it
caused
devastation
by
burrowing
and
by
devouring
the
herbage
which
might
have
maintained
millions
of
sheep
and
cattle
scientists
discovered
that
this
particular
variety
of
rabbit
and
apparently
no
other
animal
was
susceptible
to
a
fatal
virus
disease
myxomatosis
by
infecting
animals
and
letting
them
loose
in
the
burrows
local
epidemics
of
this
disease
could
be
created
later
it
was
found
that
there
was
a
type
of
mosquito
which
acted
as
the
carrier
of
this
disease
and
passed
it
on
to
the
rabbits
so
while
the
rest
of
the
world
was
trying
to
get
rid
of
mosquitoes
australia
was
encouraging
this
one
it
effectively
spread
the
disease
all
over
the
continent
and
drastically
reduced
the
rabbit
population
it
later
became
apparent
that
rabbits
were
developing
a
degree
of
resistance
to
this
disease
so
that
the
rabbit
population
was
unlikely
to
be
completely
exterminated
there
were
hopes
however
that
the
problem
of
the
rabbit
would
become
manageable
ironically
europe
which
had
bequeathed
the
rabbit
as
a
pest
to
australia
acquired
this
man
made
disease
as
a
pestilence
a
french
physician
decided
to
get
rid
of
the
wild
rabbits
on
his
own
estate
and
introduced
myxomatosis
it
did
not
however
remain
within
the
confines
of
his
estate
it
spread
through
france
where
wild
rabbits
are
not
generally
regarded
as
a
pest
but
as
a
sport
and
a
useful
food
supply
and
it
spread
to
britain
where
wild
rabbits
are
regarded
as
a
pest
but
where
domesticated
rabbits
equally
susceptible
to
the
disease
are
the
basis
of
a
profitable
fur
industry
the
question
became
one
of
whether
man
could
control
the
disease
he
had
invented
there
has
long
been
a
superstition
among
mariners
that
porpoises
will
save
drowning
men
by
pushing
them
to
the
surface
or
protect
them
from
sharks
by
surrounding
them
in
defensive
formation
marine
studio
biologists
have
pointed
out
that
however
intelligent
they
may
be
it
is
probably
a
mistake
to
credit
dolphins
with
any
motive
of
life
saving
on
the
occasions
when
they
have
pushed
to
shore
an
unconscious
human
being
they
have
much
more
likely
done
it
out
of
curiosity
or
for
sport
as
in
riding
the
bow
waves
of
a
ship
in
some
porpoises
were
photographed
working
like
beavers
to
push
ashore
a
waterlogged
mattress
if
as
has
been
reported
they
have
protected
humans
from
sharks
it
may
have
been
because
curiosity
attracted
them
and
because
the
scent
of
a
possible
meal
attracted
the
sharks
porpoises
and
sharks
are
natural
enemies
it
is
possible
that
upon
such
an
occasion
a
battle
ensued
with
the
sharks
being
driven
away
or
killed
whether
it
be
bird
fish
or
beast
the
porpoise
is
intrigued
with
anything
that
is
alive
they
are
constantly
after
the
turtles
the
ferdinands
of
marine
life
who
peacefully
submit
to
all
sorts
of
indignities
one
young
calf
especially
enjoyed
raising
a
turtle
to
the
surface
with
his
snout
and
then
shoving
him
across
the
tank
like
an
aquaplane
almost
any
day
a
young
porpoise
may
be
seen
trying
to
turn
a
pound
sea
turtle
over
by
sticking
his
snout
under
the
edge
of
his
shell
and
pushing
up
for
dear
life
this
is
not
easy
and
may
require
two
porpoises
working
together
in
another
game
as
the
turtle
swims
across
the
oceanarium
the
first
porpoise
swoops
down
from
above
and
butts
his
shell
with
his
belly
this
knocks
the
turtle
down
several
feet
he
no
sooner
recovers
his
equilibrium
than
the
next
porpoise
comes
along
and
hits
him
another
crack
eventually
the
turtle
has
been
butted
all
the
way
down
to
the
floor
of
the
tank
he
is
now
satisfied
merely
to
try
to
stand
up
but
as
soon
as
he
does
so
a
porpoise
knocks
him
flat
the
turtle
at
last
gives
up
by
pulling
his
feet
under
his
shell
and
the
game
is
over
it
is
fairly
clear
that
the
sleeping
period
must
have
some
function
and
because
there
is
so
much
of
it
the
function
would
seem
to
be
important
speculations
about
its
nature
have
been
going
on
for
literally
thousands
of
years
and
one
odd
finding
that
makes
the
problem
puzzling
is
that
it
looks
very
much
as
if
sleeping
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
giving
the
body
a
rest
rest
in
terms
of
muscle
relaxation
and
so
on
can
be
achieved
by
a
brief
period
lying
or
even
sitting
down
the
body
s
tissues
are
self
repairing
and
self
restoring
to
a
degree
and
function
best
when
more
or
less
continuously
active
in
fact
a
basic
amount
of
movement
occurs
during
sleep
which
is
specifically
concerned
with
preventing
muscle
inactivity
if
it
is
not
a
question
of
resting
the
body
then
perhaps
it
is
the
brain
that
needs
resting
this
might
be
a
plausible
hypothesis
were
it
not
for
two
factors
first
the
electroencephalograph
which
is
simply
a
device
for
recording
the
electrical
activity
of
the
brain
by
attaching
electrodes
to
the
scalp
shows
that
while
there
is
a
change
in
the
pattern
of
activity
during
sleep
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
total
amount
of
activity
is
any
less
the
second
factor
is
more
interesting
and
more
fundamental
in
l
an
american
psychiatrist
named
william
dement
published
experiments
dealing
with
the
recording
of
eye
movements
during
sleep
he
showed
that
the
average
individual
s
sleep
cycle
is
punctuated
with
peculiar
bursts
of
eye
movements
some
drifting
and
slow
others
jerky
and
rapid
people
woken
during
these
periods
of
eye
movements
generally
reported
that
they
had
been
dreaming
when
woken
at
other
times
they
reported
no
dreams
if
one
group
of
people
were
disturbed
from
their
eye
movement
sleep
for
several
nights
on
end
and
another
group
were
disturbed
for
an
equal
period
of
time
but
when
they
were
not
exhibiting
eye
movements
the
first
group
began
to
show
some
personality
disorders
while
the
others
seemed
more
or
less
unaffected
the
implications
of
all
this
were
that
it
was
not
the
disturbance
of
sleep
that
mattered
but
the
disturbance
of
dreaming
walking
for
walking
s
sake
may
be
as
highly
laudable
and
exemplary
a
thing
as
it
is
held
to
be
by
those
who
practise
it
my
objection
to
it
is
that
it
stops
the
brain
many
a
man
has
professed
to
me
that
his
brain
never
works
so
well
as
when
he
is
swinging
along
the
high
road
or
over
hill
and
dale
this
boast
is
not
confirmed
by
my
memory
of
anybody
who
on
a
sunday
morning
has
forced
meto
partake
of
his
adventure
experience
teaches
me
that
whatever
a
fellow
guest
may
have
of
power
to
instruct
or
to
amuse
when
he
is
sitting
in
a
chair
or
standing
on
a
hearth
rug
quickly
leaves
him
when
he
takes
one
out
for
a
walk
the
ideas
that
come
so
thick
and
fast
to
him
in
any
room
where
are
they
now
where
that
encyclopaedic
knowledge
which
he
bore
so
lightly
where
the
kindling
fancy
that
played
like
summer
lightning
over
any
topic
that
was
started
the
man
s
face
that
was
so
mobile
is
set
now
gone
is
the
light
from
his
fine
eyes
he
says
that
a
our
host
is
a
thoroughly
good
fellow
fifty
yards
further
on
he
adds
that
a
is
one
of
the
best
fellows
he
has
ever
met
we
tramp
another
furlong
or
so
and
he
says
that
mrs
a
is
a
charming
woman
presently
he
adds
that
she
is
one
of
the
most
charming
women
he
has
ever
known
we
pass
an
inn
he
readsvapidly
aloud
to
me
the
king
s
arms
licensed
to
sell
ales
and
spirits
i
foresee
that
during
the
rest
of
the
walk
he
will
read
aloud
any
inscription
that
occurs
we
pass
a
milestone
he
points
at
it
with
his
stick
and
says
uxminster
ii
miles
we
turn
a
sharp
corner
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
he
points
at
the
wall
and
says
drive
slowly
i
see
far
ahead
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
bordering
the
high
road
a
small
notice
board
he
sees
it
too
he
keeps
his
eye
on
it
and
in
due
course
trespassers
he
says
will
be
prosecuted
poor
man
mentally
a
wreck
how
it
came
about
that
snakes
manufactured
poison
is
a
mystery
over
the
periods
their
saliva
a
mild
digestive
juice
like
our
own
was
converted
into
a
poison
that
defies
analysis
even
today
it
was
not
forced
upon
them
by
the
survival
competition
they
could
have
caught
and
lived
on
prey
without
using
poison
just
as
the
thousands
of
non
poisonous
snakes
still
do
poison
to
a
snake
is
merely
a
luxury
it
enables
it
to
get
its
food
with
very
little
effort
no
more
effort
than
one
bite
and
why
only
snakes
cats
for
instance
would
be
greatly
helped
no
running
rights
with
large
fierce
rats
or
tussles
with
grown
rabbits
just
a
bite
and
no
more
effort
needed
in
fact
it
would
be
an
assistance
to
all
the
carnivorae
though
it
would
be
a
two
edged
weapon
when
they
fought
each
other
but
of
the
vertebrates
unpredictable
nature
selected
only
snakes
and
one
lizard
one
wonders
also
why
nature
with
some
snakes
concocted
poison
of
such
extreme
potency
in
the
conversion
of
saliva
into
poison
one
might
suppose
that
a
fixed
process
took
place
it
did
not
some
snakes
manufactured
a
poison
different
in
every
respect
from
that
of
others
as
different
as
arsenic
is
from
strychnine
and
having
different
effects
one
poison
acts
on
the
nerves
the
other
on
the
blood
the
makers
of
the
nerve
poison
include
the
mambas
and
the
cobras
and
their
venom
is
called
neurotoxic
vipers
adders
and
rattlesnakes
manufacture
the
blood
poison
which
is
known
as
haemolytic
both
poisons
are
unpleasant
but
by
far
the
more
unpleasant
is
the
blood
poison
it
is
said
that
the
nerve
poison
is
the
more
primitive
of
the
two
that
the
blood
poison
is
so
to
speak
a
newer
product
from
an
improved
formula
be
that
as
it
may
the
nerve
poison
does
its
business
with
man
far
more
quickly
than
the
blood
poison
this
however
means
nothing
snakes
did
not
acquire
their
poison
for
use
against
man
but
for
use
against
prey
such
as
rats
and
mice
and
the
effects
on
these
of
viperine
poison
is
almost
immediate
william
s
hart
was
perhaps
the
greatest
of
all
western
stars
for
unlike
gary
cooper
and
john
wayne
he
appeared
in
nothing
but
westerns
from
to
he
was
supreme
and
unchallenged
it
was
hart
who
created
the
basic
formula
of
the
western
film
and
devised
the
protagonist
he
played
in
every
film
he
made
the
good
bad
man
the
accidental
noble
outlaw
or
the
honest
but
framed
cowboy
or
the
sheriff
made
suspect
by
vicious
gossip
in
short
the
individual
in
conflict
with
himself
and
his
frontier
environment
unlike
most
of
his
contemporaries
in
hollywood
hart
actually
knew
something
of
the
old
west
he
had
lived
in
it
as
a
child
when
it
was
already
disappearing
and
his
hero
was
firmly
rooted
in
his
memories
and
experiences
and
in
both
the
history
and
the
mythology
of
the
vanished
frontier
and
although
no
period
or
place
in
american
history
has
been
more
absurdly
romanticized
myth
and
reality
did
join
hands
in
at
least
one
arena
the
conflict
between
the
individual
and
encroaching
civilization
men
accustomed
to
struggling
for
survival
against
the
elements
and
indian
were
bewildered
by
politicians
bankers
and
business
men
and
unhorsed
by
fences
laws
and
alien
taboos
hart
s
good
bad
man
was
always
an
outsider
always
one
of
the
disinherited
and
if
he
found
it
necessary
to
shoot
a
sheriff
or
rob
a
bank
along
the
way
his
early
audiences
found
it
easy
to
understand
andforgive
especially
when
it
was
hart
who
in
the
end
overcame
the
attacking
indians
audiences
in
the
second
decade
of
the
twentieth
century
found
it
pleasant
to
escape
to
a
time
when
life
though
hard
was
relatively
simple
we
still
do
living
in
a
world
in
which
undeclared
aggression
war
hypocrisy
chicanery
anarchy
and
impending
immolation
are
part
of
our
daily
lives
we
all
want
a
code
to
live
by
why
does
the
idea
of
progress
loom
so
large
in
the
modern
world
surely
because
progress
of
a
particular
kind
is
actually
taking
place
around
us
and
is
becoming
more
and
more
manifest
although
mankind
has
undergone
no
general
improvement
in
intelligence
or
morality
it
has
made
extraordinary
progress
the
accumulation
of
knowledge
knowledge
began
to
increase
as
soon
as
the
thoughts
of
one
individual
could
be
communicated
to
another
by
means
of
speech
with
the
invention
of
writing
a
great
advance
was
made
for
knowledge
could
then
be
not
only
communicated
but
also
stored
libraries
made
education
possible
and
education
in
its
turn
added
to
libraries
the
growth
of
knowledge
followed
a
kind
of
compound
interest
law
which
was
greatly
enhanced
by
the
invention
of
printing
all
this
was
comparatively
slow
until
with
the
coming
science
the
tempo
was
suddenly
raised
then
knowledge
began
to
be
accumulated
according
to
a
systematic
plan
the
trickle
became
a
stream
the
stream
has
now
become
a
torrent
moreover
as
soon
as
new
knowledge
is
acquired
it
is
now
turned
to
practical
account
what
is
called
modern
civilization
is
not
the
result
of
a
balanced
development
of
all
man
s
nature
but
of
accumulated
knowledge
applied
to
practical
life
the
problem
now
facing
humanity
is
what
is
going
to
be
done
with
all
this
knowledge
as
is
so
often
pointed
out
knowledge
is
a
two
edged
weapon
which
can
be
used
equally
for
good
or
evil
it
is
now
being
used
indifferently
for
both
could
any
spectacle
for
instance
be
more
grimly
whimsical
than
that
of
gunners
using
science
to
shatter
men
s
bodies
while
close
at
hand
surgeons
use
it
to
restore
them
we
have
to
ask
ourselves
very
seriously
what
will
happen
if
this
twofold
use
of
knowledge
with
its
ever
increasing
power
continues
no
two
sorts
of
birds
practise
quite
the
same
sort
of
flight
the
varieties
are
infinite
but
two
classes
may
be
roughly
seen
any
ship
that
crosses
the
pacific
is
accompanied
for
many
days
by
the
smaller
albatross
which
may
keep
company
with
the
vessel
for
an
hour
without
visible
or
more
than
occasional
movement
of
wing
the
currents
of
air
that
the
walls
of
the
ship
direct
upwards
as
well
as
in
the
line
of
its
course
are
enough
to
give
the
great
bird
with
its
immense
wings
sufficient
sustenance
and
progress
the
albatross
is
the
king
of
the
gliders
the
class
of
fliers
which
harness
the
air
to
their
purpose
but
must
yield
to
its
opposition
in
the
contrary
school
the
duck
is
supreme
it
comes
nearer
to
the
engines
with
which
man
has
conquered
the
air
as
he
boasts
duck
and
like
them
the
pigeons
are
endowed
with
steel
like
muscles
that
are
a
good
part
of
the
weight
of
the
bird
and
these
will
ply
the
short
wings
with
irresistible
power
that
they
can
bore
for
long
distances
through
an
opposite
gale
before
exhaustion
follows
their
humbler
followers
such
as
partridges
have
a
like
power
of
strong
propulsion
but
soon
tire
you
may
pick
them
up
in
utter
exhaustion
if
wind
over
the
sea
has
driven
them
to
a
long
journey
the
swallow
shares
the
virtues
of
both
schools
in
highest
measure
it
tires
not
nor
does
it
boast
of
its
power
but
belongs
to
the
air
travelling
it
may
be
six
thousand
miles
to
and
from
its
northern
nesting
home
feeding
its
flown
young
as
it
flies
and
slipping
through
a
medium
that
seems
to
help
its
passage
even
when
the
wind
is
adverse
such
birds
do
us
good
though
we
no
longer
take
omens
from
their
flight
on
this
side
and
that
and
even
the
most
superstitious
villagers
no
longer
take
off
their
hats
to
the
magpie
and
wish
it
good
morning
a
young
man
sees
a
sunset
and
unable
to
understand
or
to
express
the
emotion
that
it
rouses
in
him
concludes
that
it
must
be
the
gateway
to
a
world
that
lies
beyond
it
is
difficult
for
any
of
us
in
moments
of
intense
aesthetic
experience
to
resist
the
suggestion
that
we
are
catching
a
glimpse
of
a
light
that
shines
down
to
us
from
a
different
realm
of
existence
different
and
because
the
experience
is
intensely
moving
in
some
way
higher
and
though
the
gleams
blind
and
dazzle
yet
do
they
convey
a
hint
of
beauty
and
serenity
greater
than
we
have
known
or
imagined
greater
too
than
we
can
describe
for
language
which
was
invented
to
convey
the
meanings
of
this
world
cannot
readily
be
fitted
to
the
uses
of
another
that
all
great
art
has
this
power
of
suggesting
a
world
beyond
is
undeniable
in
some
moods
nature
shares
it
there
is
no
sky
in
june
so
blue
that
it
does
not
point
forward
to
a
bluer
no
sunset
so
beautiful
that
it
does
not
waken
the
vision
of
a
greater
beauty
a
vision
which
passes
before
it
is
fully
glimpsed
and
in
passing
leaves
an
indefinable
longing
and
regret
but
if
this
world
is
not
merely
a
bad
joke
life
a
vulgar
flare
amid
the
cool
radiance
of
the
stars
and
existence
an
empty
laugh
braying
across
the
mysteries
if
these
intimations
of
a
something
behind
and
beyond
are
not
evil
humour
born
of
indigestion
or
whimsies
sent
by
the
devil
to
mock
and
madden
us
if
in
a
word
beauty
means
something
yet
we
must
not
seek
to
interpret
the
meaning
if
we
glimpse
the
unutterable
it
is
unwise
to
try
to
utter
it
nor
should
we
seek
to
invest
with
significance
that
whichwe
cannot
grasp
beauty
in
terms
of
our
human
meanings
is
meaningless
each
civilization
is
born
it
culminates
and
it
decays
there
is
a
widespread
testimony
that
this
ominous
fact
is
due
to
inherent
biological
defects
in
the
crowded
life
of
cities
now
slowly
and
at
first
faintly
an
opposite
tendency
is
showing
itself
better
roads
and
better
vehicles
at
first
induced
the
wealthier
classes
to
live
on
the
outskirts
of
the
cities
the
urgent
need
for
defence
had
also
vanished
this
tendency
is
now
spreading
rapidly
downwards
but
a
new
set
of
conditions
is
just
showing
itself
up
to
the
present
time
throughout
the
eighteenth
and
nineteenth
centuries
this
new
tendency
placed
the
home
in
the
immediate
suburbs
but
concentrated
manufacturing
activity
business
relations
government
and
pleasure
in
the
centres
of
the
cities
apart
from
the
care
of
children
and
periods
of
sheer
rest
the
active
lives
were
spent
in
the
cities
in
some
ways
the
concentration
of
such
activities
was
even
more
emphasized
and
the
homes
were
pushed
outwards
even
at
the
cost
of
the
discomfort
of
commuting
but
if
we
examine
the
trend
of
technology
during
the
past
generation
the
reasons
for
this
concentration
are
largely
disappearing
still
more
the
reasons
for
the
choice
of
sites
for
cities
are
also
altering
mechanical
power
can
be
transmitted
for
hundreds
of
miles
men
can
communicate
almost
instantaneously
by
telephone
the
chiefs
of
great
organizations
can
be
transported
by
airplanes
the
cinemas
can
produce
plays
in
every
village
music
speeches
and
sermons
can
be
broadcast
almost
every
reason
for
the
growth
of
the
cities
concurrently
with
the
growth
of
civilization
has
been
profoundly
modified
many
people
in
industry
and
the
services
who
have
practical
experience
of
noise
regard
any
investigation
of
this
question
as
a
waste
of
time
they
are
not
prepared
even
to
admit
the
possibility
that
noise
affects
people
on
the
other
hand
those
who
dislike
noise
will
sometimes
use
most
inadequate
evidence
to
support
their
pleas
for
a
quieter
society
this
is
a
pity
because
noise
abatement
really
is
a
good
cause
and
it
is
likely
to
be
discredited
if
it
gets
to
be
associatedwith
bad
science
one
allegation
often
made
is
that
noise
produces
mental
illness
a
recent
article
in
a
weekly
newspaper
for
instance
was
headed
with
a
striking
illustration
of
a
lady
in
a
state
of
considerable
distress
with
the
caption
she
was
yet
another
victim
reduced
to
a
screaming
wreck
on
turning
eagerly
to
the
text
one
learns
that
the
lady
was
a
typist
who
found
the
sound
of
office
typewriters
worried
her
more
and
more
until
eventually
she
had
to
go
into
a
mental
hospital
now
the
snag
in
this
sort
of
anecdote
is
of
course
that
one
cannot
distinguish
cause
and
effect
was
the
noise
a
cause
of
the
illness
or
were
the
complaints
about
noise
merely
a
symptom
another
patient
might
equally
well
complain
that
her
neigh
bours
were
combining
to
slander
her
and
persecute
her
and
yet
one
might
be
cautious
about
believing
this
statement
what
is
needed
in
the
case
of
noise
is
a
study
of
large
numbers
of
people
living
under
noisy
conditions
to
discover
whether
they
are
mentally
ill
more
often
than
other
people
are
the
united
states
navy
for
instance
recently
examined
a
very
large
number
of
men
working
on
aircraft
carriers
the
study
was
known
as
project
anehin
it
can
be
unpleasant
to
live
even
several
miles
from
an
aerodrome
if
you
think
what
it
must
be
like
to
share
the
deck
of
a
ship
with
several
squadrons
of
jet
aircraft
you
will
realize
that
a
modern
navy
is
a
good
place
to
study
noise
but
neither
psychiatric
interviews
nor
objective
tests
were
able
to
show
any
effects
upon
these
american
sailors
this
result
merely
confirms
earlier
american
and
british
studies
if
there
is
any
effect
of
noise
upon
mental
health
it
must
be
so
small
that
present
methods
of
psychiatric
diagnosis
cannot
find
it
that
does
not
prove
that
it
does
not
exist
but
it
does
mean
that
noise
is
less
dangerous
than
say
being
brought
up
in
an
orphanages
which
really
is
a
mental
health
hazard
it
is
animals
and
plants
which
lived
in
or
near
water
whose
remains
are
most
likely
to
be
preserved
for
one
of
the
necessary
conditions
of
preservation
is
quick
burial
and
it
is
only
in
the
seas
and
rivers
and
sometimes
lakes
where
mud
and
silt
have
been
continuously
deposited
that
bodies
and
the
like
can
be
rapidly
covered
over
and
preserved
but
even
in
the
most
favourable
circumstances
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
creatures
that
die
are
preserved
in
this
way
before
decay
sets
in
or
even
more
likely
before
scavengers
eat
them
after
all
all
living
creatures
live
by
feeding
on
something
else
whether
it
be
plant
or
animal
dead
or
alive
and
it
is
only
by
chance
that
such
a
fate
is
avoided
the
remains
of
plants
and
animals
that
lived
on
land
are
much
more
rarely
preserved
for
there
is
seldom
anything
to
cover
them
over
when
you
think
of
the
innumerable
birds
that
one
sees
flying
about
not
to
mention
the
equally
numerous
small
animals
like
field
mice
and
voles
which
you
do
not
see
it
is
very
rarely
that
one
comes
across
a
dead
body
except
of
course
on
the
roads
they
decompose
and
are
quickly
destroyed
by
the
weather
or
eaten
by
some
other
creature
it
is
almost
always
due
to
some
very
special
circumstances
that
traces
of
land
animals
survive
as
by
falling
into
inaccessible
caves
or
into
an
ice
crevasse
like
the
siberian
mammoths
when
the
whole
animal
is
sometimes
preserved
as
in
a
refrigerator
this
is
what
happened
to
the
famous
beresovka
mammoth
which
was
found
preserved
and
in
good
condition
in
his
mouth
were
the
remains
of
fir
trees
the
last
meal
that
he
had
before
he
fell
into
the
crevasse
and
broke
his
back
the
mammoth
has
now
been
restored
in
the
palaeontological
museum
in
leningrad
other
animals
were
trapped
in
tar
pits
like
the
elephants
sabre
toothed
cats
and
numerous
other
creatures
that
are
found
at
rancho
la
brea
which
is
now
just
a
suburb
of
los
angeles
apparently
what
happened
was
that
water
collected
on
these
tar
pits
and
the
bigger
animals
like
the
elephants
ventured
out
on
to
the
apparently
firm
surface
to
drink
and
were
promptly
bogged
in
the
tar
and
then
when
they
were
dead
the
carnivores
like
the
sabre
toothed
cats
and
the
giant
wolves
came
out
to
feed
and
suffered
exactly
the
same
fate
there
are
also
endless
numbers
of
birds
in
the
tar
as
well
from
the
seventeenth
century
empire
of
sweden
the
story
of
a
galleon
that
sank
at
the
start
of
her
maiden
voyage
in
must
be
one
of
the
strangest
tales
of
the
sea
for
nearly
three
and
a
half
centuries
she
lay
at
the
bottom
of
stockholm
harbour
until
her
discovery
in
this
was
the
vasa
royal
flagship
of
the
great
imperial
fleet
king
gustavus
adolphus
the
northern
hurricane
then
at
the
height
of
his
military
success
in
the
thirty
years
war
had
dictated
her
measurements
and
armament
triple
gun
decks
mounted
sixty
four
bronze
cannon
she
was
intended
to
play
a
leading
role
in
the
growing
might
of
sweden
as
she
was
prepared
for
her
maiden
voyage
on
august
stockholm
was
in
a
ferment
from
the
skeppsbron
and
surrounding
islands
the
people
watched
this
thing
of
beauty
begin
to
spread
her
sails
and
catch
the
wind
they
had
laboured
for
three
years
to
produce
this
floating
work
of
art
she
was
more
richly
carved
and
ornamented
than
any
previous
ship
the
high
stern
castle
was
a
riot
of
carved
gods
demons
knights
kings
warriors
mermaids
cherubs
and
zoomorphi
c
animal
shapes
ablaze
with
red
and
gold
and
blue
symbols
of
courage
power
and
cruelty
were
portrayed
to
stir
the
imaginations
of
the
superstitious
sailors
of
the
day
then
the
cannons
of
the
anchored
warships
thundered
a
salute
to
which
the
vasa
fired
in
reply
as
she
emerged
from
her
drifting
cloud
of
gun
smoke
with
the
water
churned
to
foam
beneath
her
bow
her
flags
flying
pennants
waving
sails
filling
in
the
breeze
and
the
red
and
gold
of
her
superstructure
ablaze
with
colour
she
presented
a
more
majestic
spectacle
than
stockholmers
had
ever
seen
before
all
gun
ports
were
open
and
the
muzzles
peeped
wickedly
from
them
as
the
wind
freshened
there
came
a
sudden
squall
and
the
ship
made
a
strange
movement
listing
to
port
the
ordnance
officer
ordered
all
the
port
cannon
to
be
heaved
to
starboard
to
counteract
the
list
but
the
steepening
angle
of
the
decks
increased
then
the
sound
of
rumbling
thunder
reached
the
watchers
on
the
shore
as
cargo
ballast
ammunition
and
people
went
sliding
and
crashing
down
to
the
port
side
of
the
steeply
listing
ship
the
lower
gun
ports
were
now
below
water
and
the
inrush
sealed
the
ship
s
fate
in
that
first
glorious
hour
the
mighty
vasa
which
was
intended
to
rule
the
baltic
sank
with
all
flags
flying
in
the
harbour
of
her
birth
this
is
a
sceptical
age
but
although
our
faith
in
many
of
the
things
in
which
our
forefathers
fervently
believed
has
weakened
our
confidence
in
the
curative
properties
of
the
bottle
of
medicine
remains
the
same
as
theirs
this
modern
faith
in
medicines
is
roved
by
the
fact
that
the
annual
drug
bill
of
the
health
services
is
mounting
to
astronomical
figures
and
shows
no
signs
at
present
of
ceasing
to
rise
the
majority
of
the
patients
attending
the
medical
out
patients
departments
of
our
hospitals
feel
that
they
have
not
received
adequate
treatment
unless
they
are
able
to
carry
home
with
them
some
tangible
remedy
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
of
medicine
a
box
of
pills
or
a
small
jar
of
ointment
and
the
doctor
in
charge
of
the
department
is
only
too
ready
to
provide
them
with
these
requirements
there
is
no
quicker
method
of
disposing
of
patients
than
by
giving
them
what
they
are
asking
for
and
since
most
medical
men
in
the
health
services
are
overworked
and
have
little
time
for
offering
time
consuming
and
little
appreciated
advice
on
such
subjects
as
diet
right
living
and
the
need
for
abandoning
bad
habits
etc
the
bottle
the
box
and
the
jar
are
almost
always
granted
them
nor
is
it
only
the
ignorant
and
ill
educated
person
who
has
such
faith
in
the
bottle
of
medicine
especially
if
it
be
wrapped
in
white
paper
and
sealed
with
a
dab
of
red
sealing
wax
by
a
clever
chemist
it
is
recounted
of
thomas
carlyle
that
when
he
heard
of
the
illness
of
his
friend
henry
taylor
he
went
off
immediately
to
visit
him
carrying
with
him
in
his
pocket
what
remained
of
abottle
of
medicine
formerly
prescribed
for
an
indisposition
of
mrs
carlyle
s
carlyle
was
entirely
ignorant
of
what
the
bottle
in
his
pocket
contained
of
the
nature
of
the
illness
from
which
his
friend
was
suffering
and
of
what
had
previously
been
wrong
with
his
wife
but
a
medicine
that
had
worked
so
well
in
one
form
of
illness
would
surely
be
of
equal
benefit
in
another
and
comforted
by
the
thought
of
the
help
he
was
bringing
to
his
friend
he
hastened
to
henry
taylor
s
house
history
does
not
relate
whether
his
friend
accepted
his
medical
help
but
in
all
probability
he
did
the
great
advantage
of
taking
medicine
is
that
it
makes
no
demands
on
the
taker
beyond
that
of
putting
up
for
a
moment
with
a
disgusting
taste
and
that
is
what
all
patients
demand
of
their
doctors
to
be
cured
at
no
inconvenience
to
themselves
many
strange
new
means
of
transport
have
been
developed
in
our
century
the
strangest
of
them
being
perhaps
the
hovercraft
in
a
former
electronics
engineer
in
his
fifties
christopher
cockerell
who
had
turned
to
boat
building
on
the
norfolk
broads
suggested
an
idea
on
which
he
had
been
working
for
many
years
to
the
british
government
and
industrial
circles
it
was
the
idea
of
supporting
a
craft
on
a
pad
or
cushion
of
low
pressure
air
ringed
with
a
curtain
of
higher
pressure
air
ever
since
people
have
had
difficulty
in
deciding
whether
the
craft
should
be
ranged
among
ships
planes
or
land
vehicles
for
it
is
something
in
between
a
boat
and
an
aircraft
as
a
shipbuilder
cockerell
was
trying
to
find
a
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
wave
resistance
which
wastes
a
good
deal
of
a
surface
ship
s
power
and
limits
its
speed
his
answer
was
to
lift
the
vessel
out
of
the
water
by
making
it
ride
on
a
cushion
of
air
no
more
than
one
or
two
feet
thick
this
is
done
by
a
great
number
of
ring
shaped
air
jets
on
the
bottom
of
the
craft
it
flies
therefore
but
it
cannot
fly
higher
its
action
de
pends
on
the
surface
water
or
ground
over
which
it
rides
the
first
tests
on
the
solent
in
caused
a
sensation
the
hovercraft
travelled
first
over
the
water
then
mounted
the
beach
climbed
up
the
dunes
and
sat
down
on
a
road
later
it
crossed
the
channel
riding
smoothly
over
the
waves
which
presented
no
problem
since
that
time
various
types
of
hovercraft
have
appeared
and
taken
up
regular
service
cruises
on
the
thames
in
london
for
instance
have
become
an
annual
attraction
but
we
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
a
development
that
may
transport
net
sea
and
land
transport
christopher
cockerell
s
craft
can
establish
transport
works
in
large
areas
with
poor
communications
such
as
africa
or
australia
it
can
become
a
flying
fruit
bowl
carrying
bananas
from
the
plantations
to
the
ports
giant
hovercraft
liners
could
span
the
atlantic
and
the
railway
of
the
future
may
well
be
the
hovertrain
riding
on
its
air
cushion
over
a
single
rail
which
it
never
touches
at
speeds
up
to
m
p
h
the
possibilities
appear
unlimited
our
knowledge
of
the
oceans
a
hundred
years
ago
was
confined
to
the
two
dimensional
shape
of
the
sea
surface
and
the
hazards
of
navigation
presented
by
the
irregularities
in
depth
of
the
shallow
water
close
to
the
land
the
open
sea
was
deep
and
mysterious
and
anyone
who
gave
more
than
a
passing
thought
to
the
bottom
confines
of
the
oceans
probably
assumed
that
the
sea
bed
was
flat
sir
james
clark
ross
had
obtained
a
sounding
of
over
fathoms
in
butit
was
not
until
when
h
m
s
porcupine
was
put
at
the
disposal
of
the
royal
society
for
several
cruises
that
a
series
of
deep
soundings
was
obtained
in
the
atlantic
and
the
first
samples
were
collected
by
dredging
the
bottom
shortly
after
this
the
famous
h
m
s
challenger
expedition
established
the
study
of
the
sea
floor
as
a
subject
worthy
of
the
most
qualified
physicists
and
geologists
a
burst
of
activity
associated
with
the
laying
of
submarine
cables
soon
confirmed
the
challenger
s
observation
that
many
parts
of
the
ocean
were
two
to
three
miles
deep
and
the
existence
of
underwater
features
of
considerable
magnitude
today
enough
soundings
are
available
to
enable
a
relief
map
of
the
atlantic
to
be
drawn
and
we
know
something
of
the
great
variety
of
the
sea
bed
s
topography
since
the
sea
covers
the
greater
part
of
the
earth
s
surface
it
is
quite
reasonable
to
regard
the
sea
floor
as
the
basic
form
of
the
crust
of
the
earth
with
superimposed
upon
it
the
continents
together
with
the
islands
and
other
featuresof
the
oceans
the
continents
form
rugged
tablelands
which
stand
nearly
three
miles
above
the
floor
of
the
open
ocean
from
the
shore
line
out
to
a
distance
which
may
be
anywhere
from
a
few
miles
to
a
few
hundred
miles
runs
the
gentle
slope
of
the
continental
shelf
geologically
part
of
the
continents
the
real
dividing
line
between
continents
and
oceans
occurs
at
the
foot
of
a
steeper
slope
this
continental
slope
usually
starts
at
a
place
somewhere
near
the
ice
fathom
mark
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
hundred
miles
reaches
the
true
ocean
floor
at
fathoms
the
slope
averages
about
in
but
contains
steep
probably
vertical
cliffs
and
gentle
sediment
covered
terraces
and
near
its
lower
reaches
there
is
a
long
tailing
off
which
is
almost
certainly
the
result
of
material
transported
out
to
deep
water
after
being
eroded
from
the
continental
masses
the
victorians
realizing
that
the
greatest
happiness
accorded
to
man
is
that
provided
by
a
happy
marriage
endeavoured
to
pretend
that
all
their
marriages
were
happy
we
for
our
part
admitting
the
fact
that
no
feat
of
intelligence
and
character
is
so
exacting
as
that
required
of
two
people
who
desire
to
live
permanently
together
on
a
basis
of
amity
are
obsessed
by
the
problem
of
how
to
render
the
basic
facts
of
cohabitation
simpler
and
more
reasonable
in
order
that
unhappy
marriages
may
less
frequently
result
the
victorians
would
have
considered
it
painful
or
unpleasant
were
one
to
point
out
that
only
four
marriages
out
of
every
ten
are
anything
but
forced
servitudes
we
ourselves
start
from
this
very
assumption
and
try
to
build
from
it
a
theory
of
more
sensible
relations
between
the
sexes
of
all
forms
of
arrant
untruthfulness
victorian
optimism
appears
to
me
to
have
been
the
most
cowardly
and
the
most
damaging
truth
therefore
is
an
attitude
of
the
mind
it
is
important
if
one
does
not
wish
to
inconvenience
and
to
bore
one
s
friends
not
to
tell
lies
but
it
is
more
important
not
to
think
lies
or
to
slide
into
those
mechanical
and
untruthful
habits
of
thought
which
are
so
pleasant
and
so
easy
as
descents
to
mental
ineptitude
the
victorian
habit
of
mind
which
i
consider
to
have
been
a
bad
habit
of
mind
was
unduly
preoccupied
by
what
was
socially
and
morally
convenient
convenience
is
however
in
all
affairs
of
life
an
execrable
test
of
value
one
should
have
the
courage
to
think
uncomfortably
since
it
is
only
by
rejecting
the
convenient
that
one
can
come
to
think
the
truth
not
after
all
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
truth
at
best
we
can
approach
to
some
relative
approximation
on
the
other
hand
there
is
surely
such
a
thing
as
untruth
one
is
generally
aware
when
one
has
said
something
or
acted
in
some
way
which
has
left
on
other
people
an
impression
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
the
facts
one
is
generally
aware
also
when
one
has
thrust
aside
an
inconvenient
thought
and
slid
into
its
place
another
thought
which
is
convenient
one
s
awareness
in
the
former
case
is
in
general
more
acute
than
in
the
latter
since
we
are
more
on
the
look
out
for
the
lies
we
utter
than
for
those
we
merely
think
in
fact
however
it
is
the
untruthful
thought
which
is
the
more
vicious
of
the
two
spoken
lies
are
invariably
tiresome
and
may
actually
be
dishonest
but
continuous
lying
in
the
mind
a
disease
to
which
the
anglo
saxon
is
peculiarly
exposed
spells
the
destruction
of
human
thought
and
character
appreciation
of
sculpture
depends
upon
the
abi
lity
to
respond
to
form
in
three
dimensions
that
is
perhaps
why
sculpture
has
been
described
as
the
most
difficult
of
all
arts
certainly
it
is
more
difficult
than
the
arts
which
involve
appreciation
of
flat
forms
shape
in
only
two
dimensions
many
more
people
are
form
blind
than
colour
blind
the
child
learning
to
see
first
distinguishes
only
two
dimensional
shape
it
cannot
judge
distances
depths
later
for
its
personal
safety
and
practical
needs
it
has
to
develop
partly
by
means
of
touch
the
ability
to
judge
roughly
three
dimensional
distances
but
having
satisfied
the
requirements
of
practical
necessity
most
people
go
no
further
though
they
may
attain
considerable
accuracy
in
the
perception
of
flat
form
they
do
not
make
the
further
intellectual
and
emotional
effort
needed
to
comprehend
form
in
its
full
spatial
existence
this
is
what
the
sculptor
must
do
he
must
strive
continually
to
think
of
and
use
form
in
its
full
spatial
completeness
he
gets
the
solid
shape
as
it
were
inside
his
head
he
thinks
of
it
whatever
its
size
as
if
he
were
holding
it
completely
enclosed
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
he
mentally
visualizes
a
complex
form
from
all
round
itself
he
knows
while
he
looks
at
one
side
what
the
other
side
is
like
he
identifies
himself
with
its
centre
of
gravity
its
mass
its
weight
he
realizes
its
volume
as
the
space
that
the
shape
displaces
in
the
air
and
the
sensitive
observer
of
sculpture
must
also
learn
to
feel
shape
simply
as
shape
not
as
description
or
reminiscence
he
must
for
example
perceive
an
egg
as
a
simple
single
solid
shape
quite
apart
from
its
significance
as
food
or
from
the
literary
idea
that
it
will
become
a
bird
and
so
with
solids
such
as
a
shell
a
nut
a
plum
a
pear
a
tadpole
a
mushroom
a
mountain
peak
a
kidney
a
carrot
a
tree
trunk
a
bird
a
bud
a
lark
a
ladybird
a
bulrush
a
bone
from
these
he
can
go
on
to
appreciate
more
complex
forms
of
combinations
of
several
forms
in
his
own
lifetime
galileo
was
the
centre
of
violent
controversy
but
the
scientific
dust
has
long
since
settled
and
today
we
can
see
even
his
famous
clash
with
the
inquisition
in
something
like
its
proper
perspective
but
in
contrast
it
is
only
in
modern
times
that
galileo
has
become
a
problem
child
for
historians
of
science
the
old
view
of
galileo
was
delightfully
uncomplicated
he
was
above
all
a
man
who
experimented
who
despised
the
prejudices
and
book
learning
of
the
aristotelians
who
put
his
questions
to
nature
instead
of
to
the
ancients
and
who
drew
his
conclusions
fearlessly
he
had
been
the
first
to
turn
a
telescope
to
the
sky
and
he
had
seen
there
evidence
enough
to
overthrow
aristotle
and
ptolemy
together
he
was
the
man
who
climbed
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
and
dropped
various
weights
from
the
top
who
rolled
balls
down
inclined
planes
and
then
generalized
the
results
of
his
many
experiments
into
the
famous
law
of
free
fall
but
a
closer
study
of
the
evidence
supported
by
a
deeper
sense
of
the
period
and
particularly
by
a
new
consciousness
of
the
philosophical
undercurrents
in
the
scientific
revolution
has
profoundly
modified
this
view
of
galileo
today
although
the
old
galileo
lives
on
in
many
popular
writings
among
historians
of
science
a
new
and
more
sophisticated
picture
has
emerged
at
the
same
time
our
sympathy
for
balileo
s
opponents
has
grown
somewhat
his
telescopic
observation
are
justly
immortal
they
aroused
great
interest
at
the
time
they
had
important
theoretical
consequences
and
they
provided
a
striking
demonstration
of
the
potentialities
hidden
in
instruments
and
apparatus
but
can
we
blame
those
who
looked
and
failed
to
see
what
galileo
saw
if
we
remember
that
to
use
a
telescope
at
the
limit
of
its
powers
calls
for
long
experience
and
intimate
familiarity
with
one
s
instrument
was
the
philosopher
who
refused
to
look
through
galileo
s
telescope
more
culpable
than
those
who
alleged
that
the
spiral
nebulae
observed
with
lord
rosse
s
great
telescope
in
the
eighteen
forties
were
scratches
left
by
the
grinder
we
can
perhaps
forgive
those
who
said
the
moons
of
jupiter
were
produced
by
galileo
s
spy
glass
if
we
recall
that
in
his
day
as
for
centuries
before
curved
glass
was
the
popular
contrivance
for
producing
not
truth
but
illusion
untruth
and
if
a
single
curved
glass
would
distort
nature
how
much
more
would
a
pair
of
them
populations
increase
and
decrease
relatively
not
only
to
one
another
but
also
to
natural
resources
in
most
parts
of
the
world
the
relation
between
population
and
resources
is
already
unfavourable
and
will
probably
become
even
more
unfavourable
in
the
future
this
growing
poverty
in
the
midst
of
growing
poverty
constitutes
a
permanent
menace
to
peace
and
not
only
to
peace
but
also
to
democratic
institutions
and
personal
liberty
for
overpopulation
is
not
compatib
e
with
freedom
an
unfavourable
relationship
between
numbers
and
resources
tends
to
make
the
earning
of
a
living
almost
intolerably
difficult
labour
is
more
abundant
than
goods
and
the
individual
is
compelled
to
work
long
hours
for
little
pay
no
surplus
of
accumulated
purchasing
power
stands
between
him
and
the
tyrannies
of
unfriendly
nature
or
of
the
equally
unfriendly
wielders
of
political
and
economic
power
democracy
is
among
other
things
the
ability
to
say
no
to
the
boss
but
a
man
cannot
say
no
to
the
boss
unless
he
is
sure
of
being
able
to
eat
when
the
boss
s
favour
has
been
withdrawn
and
he
cannot
be
certain
of
his
next
meal
unless
he
owns
the
means
of
producing
enough
wealth
for
his
family
to
live
on
or
has
been
able
to
accumulate
a
surplus
out
of
past
wages
or
has
a
chance
of
moving
to
virgin
territories
where
he
can
make
a
fresh
start
in
an
overcrowded
country
very
few
people
own
enough
to
make
them
financially
independent
very
few
are
in
a
position
to
accumulate
purchasing
power
and
there
is
no
free
land
moreover
in
any
country
where
population
presses
hard
upon
natural
resources
the
general
economic
situation
is
apt
to
be
so
precarious
that
government
control
of
capital
and
labour
production
and
consumption
becomes
inevitable
it
is
no
accident
that
the
twentieth
century
should
be
the
century
of
highly
centralized
governments
and
totalitarian
dictatorships
it
had
to
be
so
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
twentieth
century
is
the
century
of
planetary
overcrowding
education
is
one
of
the
key
words
of
our
time
a
man
without
an
education
many
of
us
believe
is
an
unfortunate
victim
of
adverse
circumstances
deprived
of
one
of
the
greatest
twentieth
century
opportunities
convinced
of
the
importance
of
education
modern
states
invest
in
institutions
of
learning
to
get
back
interest
in
the
form
of
a
large
group
of
enlightened
young
men
and
womenwho
are
potential
leaders
education
with
its
cycles
of
instruction
so
carefully
worked
out
punctuated
by
text
books
those
purchasable
wells
of
wisdom
what
would
civilization
be
like
without
its
benefits
so
much
is
certain
that
we
would
have
doctors
and
preachers
lawyers
and
defendants
marriages
and
births
but
our
spiritual
outlook
would
be
different
we
would
lay
less
stress
on
facts
and
figures
and
more
on
a
good
memory
on
applied
psychology
and
on
the
capacity
of
a
man
to
get
along
with
his
fellow
citizens
if
our
educational
system
were
fashioned
after
its
bookless
past
wewould
have
the
most
democratic
form
of
college
imaginable
among
the
people
whom
we
like
to
call
savages
all
knowledge
inherited
by
tradition
is
shared
by
all
it
is
taught
to
every
member
of
the
tribe
so
that
in
this
respect
everybody
is
equally
equipped
for
life
it
is
the
ideal
condition
of
the
equal
start
which
only
our
most
progressive
forms
of
modern
education
try
to
regain
in
primitive
cultures
the
obligation
to
seek
and
to
receive
the
traditional
instruction
is
binding
to
all
there
are
no
illiterates
if
the
term
can
be
applied
to
peoples
without
a
script
while
our
own
compulsory
school
attendance
became
law
in
germany
in
in
francein
and
in
england
in
and
is
still
non
existent
in
a
number
of
civilized
nations
this
shows
how
long
it
was
before
we
deemed
it
necessary
to
make
sure
that
all
our
children
could
share
in
the
knowledge
accumulated
by
the
happy
few
during
the
past
centuries
education
in
the
wilderness
is
not
a
matter
of
monetary
means
all
are
entitled
to
an
equal
start
there
is
none
of
the
hurry
which
in
our
society
often
hampers
the
full
development
of
a
growing
personality
there
a
child
grows
up
under
the
ever
present
attention
of
his
parents
therefore
the
jungles
and
the
savannahs
know
of
no
juvenile
delinquency
no
necessity
of
making
a
living
away
from
home
results
in
neglect
of
children
and
no
father
is
confronted
with
his
inability
to
buy
an
education
for
his
child
parents
are
often
upset
when
their
children
praise
the
homes
of
their
friends
and
regard
it
as
a
slur
on
their
own
cooking
or
cleaning
or
furniture
and
often
are
foolish
enough
to
let
the
adolescents
see
that
they
are
annoyed
they
may
even
accuse
them
of
disloyalty
or
make
some
spiteful
remark
about
the
friends
parents
such
a
loss
of
dignity
and
descent
into
childish
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
adults
deeply
shocks
the
adolescents
and
makes
them
resolve
that
in
future
they
will
not
talk
to
their
parents
about
the
places
or
people
they
visit
before
very
long
the
parents
will
be
complaining
that
the
child
is
so
secretive
and
never
tells
them
anything
but
they
seldom
realize
that
they
have
brought
this
on
themselves
disillusionment
with
the
parents
however
good
and
adequate
they
may
be
both
as
parents
and
as
individuals
is
to
some
degree
inevitable
most
children
have
such
a
high
ideal
of
their
parents
unless
the
parents
themselves
have
been
unsatisfactory
that
it
ca
hardly
hope
to
stand
up
to
a
realistic
evaluation
parents
would
be
greatly
surprised
and
deeply
touched
if
they
realize
how
much
belief
their
children
usually
have
in
their
character
and
infallibility
and
how
much
this
faith
means
to
a
child
if
parents
were
prepared
for
this
adolescent
reaction
and
realized
that
it
was
a
sign
that
the
child
was
growing
up
and
developing
valuable
powers
of
observation
and
independent
judgement
they
would
not
be
so
hurt
and
therefore
would
not
drive
the
child
into
opposition
by
resenting
and
resisting
it
the
adolescent
with
his
passion
for
sincerity
always
respects
a
parent
who
admits
that
he
is
wrong
or
ignorant
or
even
that
he
has
been
unfair
or
unjust
what
the
child
cannot
forgive
is
the
parents
refusal
to
admit
these
charges
if
the
child
knows
them
to
be
true
victorian
parents
believed
that
they
kept
their
dignity
by
retreating
behind
an
unreasoning
authoritarian
attitude
in
fact
hey
did
nothing
of
the
kind
but
children
were
then
too
cowed
to
let
them
know
how
they
really
felt
today
we
tend
to
go
to
the
other
extreme
but
on
the
whole
this
is
a
healthier
attitude
both
for
the
child
and
the
parent
it
is
always
wiser
and
safer
to
face
up
to
reality
however
painful
it
may
be
at
the
moment
faith
in
controlled
nuclear
fission
is
now
being
shown
by
the
construction
of
atomic
power
stations
in
britain
calder
hall
on
the
coast
of
cumberland
first
made
its
contribution
to
the
national
electricity
grid
in
subsequently
a
chain
of
nuclear
power
stations
was
planned
of
necessity
they
are
sited
near
the
coasts
or
tidal
water
because
of
the
need
of
much
water
for
cooling
and
a
certain
discharge
of
possible
radioactive
effluent
atomic
power
is
associated
in
thepublic
mind
with
the
destructive
force
of
atom
bombs
and
partly
for
this
reason
though
it
is
claimed
that
there
is
no
danger
to
be
associated
with
atomic
power
stations
they
are
being
sited
away
from
populous
centres
the
present
position
is
that
the
three
main
sources
of
power
are
coal
oil
and
water
power
we
sometimes
refer
to
electricity
gas
or
petrol
as
if
they
were
the
actual
source
of
power
forgetting
that
electricity
must
be
generated
by
the
consumption
of
coal
or
oil
or
by
the
utilization
of
water
power
whilst
coke
gas
and
petrol
are
examples
of
secondary
fuels
by
which
coal
and
oil
may
be
more
effectively
used
where
alternative
sources
of
power
are
available
there
are
some
marked
contrasts
in
handling
the
bulk
and
weight
of
coal
required
in
the
majority
of
manufacturing
industries
is
large
in
comparison
with
the
bulk
and
weight
of
other
raw
materials
this
is
not
always
true
was
with
the
manufacture
of
pig
iron
and
steel
from
low
grade
iron
ores
but
it
did
lead
to
the
concentration
ofindustrial
developments
on
the
coal
fields
a
phenomenon
well
seen
in
such
countries
as
britain
where
the
industrial
revolution
came
before
the
days
of
oil
or
electricity
coal
being

of

oil
can
be
transported
large
distances
by

but
overseas
movement
has
involved
building
of

of

including
nowsome
of
the
largest
vessels
afloat
unless
suitable
on
other
grounds
oilfields
have
not
become
industrial
regions
on
the
contrary
the
oil
industry
is
marked
by
a
certain
amount
of
smell
and
an
element
of
danger
hence
the
siting
of
refineries
at
a
distance
from
population
centres
it
is
not
always
realized
that
the
owners
of
pipelines
can
handle
the
oil
of
different
customers
sending
it

different

if
a
nation
is
essentially
disunited
it
is
left
to
the
government
to
hold
it
together
this
increases
the
expense
of
government
and
reduces
correspondingly
the
amount
of
economic
resources
that
could
be
used
for
developing
the
country
and
it
should
not
be
forgotten
how
small
those
resources
are
in
a
poor
and
backward
country
where
the
cost
of
government
is
high
resources
for
developmentare
correspondingly
low
this
may
be
illustrated
by
comparing
the
position
of
a
nation
with
that
of
a
private
business
enterprise
an
enterprise
has
to
incur
certain
costs
and
expenses
in
order
to
stay
in
business
for
our
purposes
we
are
concerned
only
with
one
kind
of
cost
the
cost
of
managing
and
administering
the
business
such
administrative
overhead
in
a
business
is
analogous
to
the
cost
of
government
in
a
nation
the
administrative
overhead
of
a
business
is
low
to
the
extent
that
everyone
working
in
the
business
can
be
trusted
to
behave
in
a
way
that
best
promotes
the
interests
of
the
firm
if
they
can
each
be
trusted
to
take
such
responsibilities
and
to
exercise
such
initiative
as
falls
within
their
sphere
then
administrative
overhead
will
be
low
it
will
be
low
because
it
will
be
necessary
to
have
only
one
man
looking
after
each
job
without
having
another
man
to
check
upon
what
he
is
doing
keep
him
in
line
and
report
on
him
to
someone
else
but
if
no
one
can
be
trusted
to
act
in
a
loyal
and
responsible
manner
towards
his
job
then
the
business
will
require
armies
of
administrators
checkers
and
foremen
and
administrative
overhead
will
rise
correspondingly
as
administrative
overhead
rises
so
the
earnings
of
the
business
after
meeting
the
expense
of
administration
will
fall
and
the
business
will
have
less
money
to
distribute
as
dividends
or
invest
directly
in
its
future
progress
and
development
it
is
precisely
the
same
with
a
nation
to
the
extent
that
the
people
can
be
relied
upon
to
behave
in
a
loyal
and
responsible
manner
the
government
does
not
require
armies
of
police
and
civil
servants
to
keep
them
in
order
but
if
a
nation
is
disunited
the
government
cannot
be
sure
that
the
actions
of
the
people
will
be
in
the
interests
of
the
nation
and
it
will
have
to
watch
check
and
control
the
people
accordingly
a
disunited
nation
therefore
has
to
incur
unduly
high
costs
of
government
at
the
age
of
twelve
years
the
human
body
is
at
its
most
vigorous
it
has
yet
to
reach
its
full
size
and
strength
and
its
owner
his
or
her
full
intelligence
but
at
this
age
the
likelihood
of
death
is
least
earlier
we
were
infants
and
young
children
and
consequently
more
vulnerable
later
we
shall
undergo
a
progressive
loss
of
our
vigour
and
resistance
which
though
imperceptible
at
first
will
finally
become
so
steep
that
we
can
live
no
longer
however
well
we
look
after
ourselves
and
however
well
society
and
our
doctors
look
after
us
this
decline
in
vigour
with
the
passing
of
time
is
called
ageing
it
is
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
discoveries
which
we
all
make
that
we
must
decline
in
this
way
that
if
we
escape
wars
accidents
and
diseases
we
shall
eventually
die
of
old
age
and
that
this
happens
at
a
rate
which
differs
little
from
person
to
person
so
that
there
are
heavy
odds
in
favour
of
our
dying
between
the
ages
of
sixty
five
and
eighty
some
of
us
will
die
sooner
a
few
will
live
longer
on
into
a
ninth
or
tenth
decade
but
the
chances
are
against
it
and
there
is
a
virtual
limit
on
how
long
we
can
hope
to
remain
alive
however
lucky
and
robust
we
are
normal
people
tend
to
forget
this
process
unless
and
until
they
are
reminded
of
it
we
are
so
familiar
with
the
fact
that
man
ages
that
people
have
for
years
assumed
that
the
process
of
losing
vigour
with
time
of
becoming
more
likely
to
die
the
older
we
get
was
something
self
evident
like
the
cooling
of
a
hot
kettle
or
the
wearing
out
of
a
pair
of
shoes
they
have
also
assumed
that
all
animals
and
probably
other
organisms
such
as
trees
or
even
the
universe
itself
must
in
the
nature
of
things
wear
out
most
animals
we
commonly
observe
do
in
fact
age
as
we
do
if
given
the
chance
to
live
long
enough
and
mechanical
systems
like
a
wound
watch
or
the
sun
do
in
fact
run
out
of
energy
in
accordance
with
the
second
law
of
thermodynamics
whether
the
whole
universe
does
so
is
a
moot
point
at
present
but
these
are
not
analogous
to
what
happens
when
man
ages
a
run
down
watch
is
still
a
watch
and
can
be
rewound
an
old
watch
by
contrast
becomes
so
worn
and
unreliable
that
it
eventually
is
not
worth
mending
but
a
watch
could
never
repair
itself
it
does
not
consist
of
living
parts
only
of
metal
which
wears
away
by
friction
we
could
at
one
time
repair
ourselves
well
enough
at
least
to
overcome
all
but
the
most
instantly
fatal
illnesses
an
accidents
between
twelve
and
eighty
years
we
gradually
lose
this
power
an
illness
which
at
twelve
would
knock
us
over
at
eighty
can
knock
us
out
and
into
our
grave
if
we
could
stay
as
vigorous
as
we
are
at
twelve
it
would
take
about
years
for
half
of
us
to
die
and
another
for
the
survivors
to
be
reduce
by
half
again
after
millennia
of
growth
so
slow
that
each
generation
hardly
noticed
it
the
cities
are
suddenly
racing
off
in
every
direction
the
world
population
goes
up
by
two
per
cent
a
year
city
population
goes
up
by
four
per
cent
a
year
but
in
big
cities
the
rate
may
be
as
much
as
five
and
six
per
cent
a
year
to
give
only
one
example
of
almost
visible
acceleration
athens
today
grows
by
three
dwellings
and
square
metres
of
road
every
hour
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
pace
will
slacken
as
technology
gradually
swallows
up
all
forms
of
work
industrial
and
agricultural
the
rural
areas
are
going
to
shrink
just
as
they
have
shrunk
in
britain
and
the
vast
majority
of
their
people
will
move
into
the
city
in
fact
in
britain
now
only
about
four
or
five
per
cent
of
people
live
in
rural
areas
and
depend
upon
them
all
through
the
developing
world
the
vanguard
of
the
rural
exodus
has
reached
the
urban
fringes
already
and
there
they
huddle
migrants
in
the
favellas
and
barrios
of
latin
america
in
shanty
towns
in
africa
in
those
horrifying
encampments
one
sees
on
the
outskirts
of
calcutta
and
bombay
we
are
heading
towards
an
urban
world
this
enormous
increase
will
go
ahead
whatever
we
do
and
we
have
to
remember
that
the
new
cities
devour
space
people
now
acquire
far
more
goods
and
things
there
is
a
greater
density
of
household
goods
they
demand
more
services
such
as
sewage
and
drainage
above
all
the
car
changes
everything
rising
incomes
and
rising
populations
can
make
urban
car
density
increase
by
something
like
four
and
five
per
cent
in
a
decade
traffic
flows
rise
to
fill
whatever
scale
of
highways
are
provided
for
them
the
car
also
has
a
curious
ambivalence
it
creates
and
then
it
destroys
mobility
the
car
tempts
people
further
out
and
then
gives
them
the
appalling
problem
of
getting
back
it
makes
them
believe
they
can
spend
sunday
in
brighton
but
makes
it
impossible
for
them
to
return
before
say
two
in
the
morning
people
go
further
and
further
away
to
reach
open
air
and
countryside
which
continuously
recedes
from
them
and
just
as
their
working
weeks
decline
and
they
begin
to
have
more
time
for
leisure
they
find
they
cannot
get
to
the
open
spaces
or
the
recreation
or
the
beaches
which
they
now
have
the
time
to
enjoy
recently
some
studies
were
made
in
the
behaviour
of
mice
when
exposed
to
more
than
a
certain
degree
of
density
frustration
and
noise
and
the
mice
just
became
deranged
i
think
some
sociologists
wonder
whether
it
might
not
be
the
same
for
men
this
combination
of
very
high
density
of
population
goods
and
services
and
machines
all
increasing
with
almost
bruta
speed
does
account
for
some
really
antisocial
tendencies
in
modern
urban
growth
the
modern
plato
like
his
ancient
counterpart
has
an
unbounded
contempt
for
politicians
and
statesmen
and
party
leaders
who
are
not
university
men
he
finds
politics
a
dirty
game
and
only
enters
them
reluctantly
because
he
knows
that
at
the
very
least
he
and
his
friends
are
better
than
the
present
gang
brought
up
in
the
traditions
of
the
ruling
classes
he
has
a
natural
pity
for
the
common
people
whom
he
has
learnt
to
know
as
servants
and
observed
from
a
distance
at
their
work
in
the
factory
at
their
play
in
the
parks
and
holiday
resorts
he
has
never
mixed
with
them
or
spoken
to
them
on
equal
terms
but
has
demanded
and
generally
received
a
respect
due
to
his
position
and
superior
intelligence
he
knows
that
if
they
trust
him
he
can
give
them
the
happiness
which
they
crave
a
man
of
culture
he
genuinely
despises
the
self
made
industrialist
and
news
paper
king
with
a
modest
professional
salary
and
a
little
private
income
of
his
own
he
regards
money
making
as
vulgar
and
avoids
all
ostentation
industry
and
finance
seem
to
him
to
be
activities
unworthy
of
gentlemen
although
alas
many
are
forced
by
exigencies
of
circumstance
to
take
some
part
in
them
intellectual
he
gently
laughs
at
the
superstitions
of
most
christians
but
attends
church
regularly
because
he
sees
the
importance
of
organized
religion
for
the
maintenance
of
sound
morality
among
the
lower
orders
and
because
he
dislikes
the
scepticism
and
materialism
of
radical
teachers
his
genuine
passions
are
for
literature
and
the
philosophy
of
science
and
he
would
gladly
spend
all
his
time
in
studying
them
but
the
plight
of
the
world
compels
his
unwilling
attention
and
when
he
sees
that
human
stupidity
and
greed
are
about
to
plunge
europe
into
chaos
and
destroy
the
most
glorious
civilization
which
the
world
has
known
he
feels
that
it
is
high
time
for
men
of
good
sense
and
good
will
to
intervene
and
to
take
politics
out
of
the
hands
of
the
plutocrats
of
the
right
and
the
woolly
minded
idealists
of
the
left
since
he
and
his
kind
are
the
only
representatives
of
decency
combined
with
intelligence
they
must
step
down
into
the
arena
and
save
the
masses
for
themselves
i
have
known
very
few
writers
but
those
i
have
known
and
whom
i
respected
confess
at
once
that
they
have
little
idea
where
they
arc
going
when
they
first
set
pen
to
paper
they
have
a
character
perhaps
two
they
are
in
that
condition
of
eager
discomfort
which
passes
for
inspiration
all
admit
radical
changes
of
destination
once
the
journey
has
begun
one
to
my
certain
knowledge
spent
nine
months
on
a
novel
about
kashmir
then
reset
the
whole
thing
in
the
scottish
highlands
i
never
heard
of
anyone
making
a
skeleton
as
we
were
taught
at
school
in
the
breaking
and
remaking
in
the
timing
interweaving
beginning
afresh
the
writer
comes
to
discern
things
in
his
material
which
were
not
consciously
in
his
mind
when
he
began
this
organic
process
often
leading
to
moments
of
extraordinary
self
discovery
is
of
an
indescribable
fascination
a
blurred
image
appears
he
adds
a
brushstroke
and
another
and
it
is
gone
but
something
was
there
and
he
will
not
rest
till
he
has
captured
it
sometimes
the
yeast
within
a
writer
outlives
a
book
he
has
written
i
have
heard
of
writers
who
read
nothing
but
their
own
books
like
adolescents
they
stand
before
the
mirror
and
still
cannot
fathom
the
exact
outline
of
the
vision
before
them
for
the
samereason
writers
talk
interminably
about
their
own
books
winkling
out
hidden
meanings
super
imposing
new
ones
begging
response
from
those
around
them
of
course
a
writer
doing
this
is
misunderstood
he
might
as
well
try
to
explain
a
crime
or
a
love
affair
he
is
also
incidentally
an
unforgivable
bore
this
temptation
to
cover
the
distance
between
himself
and
the
reader
to
study
his
image
in
the
sight
of
those
who
do
not
know
him
can
be
his
undoing
he
has
begun
to
write
to
please
a
young
english
writer
made
the
pertinent
observation
a
year
or
two
back
that
the
talent
goes
into
the
first
draft
and
the
art
into
the
drafts
that
follow
for
this
reason
also
the
writer
like
any
other
artist
has
no
resting
place
no
crowd
or
movement
in
which
he
may
take
comfort
no
judgment
from
outside
which
can
replace
the
judgment
from
within
a
writer
makes
order
out
of
the
anarchy
of
his
heart
he
submits
himself
to
a
more
ruthless
discipline
than
any
critic
dreamed
of
and
when
he
flirsts
with
fame
he
is
taking
time
off
from
living
with
himself
from
the
search
for
what
his
world
contains
at
its
inmost
point
rockets
and
artificial
satellites
can
go
far
above
the
ionosphere
and
even
escape
from
the
earth
yet
they
are
complex
and
expensive
and
in
their
present
stage
of
development
they
cannot
lift
massive
telescopes
keep
them
steady
while
the
observations
are
being
carried
out
and
then
return
them
safely
balloons
are
much
easier
to
handle
and
are
also
vastly
cheaper
their
main
limitation
is
that
they
are
incapable
of
rising
to
the
ionosphere
a
height
of
between
and
feet
is
as
much
as
can
reasonably
be
expected
and
so
balloon
borne
instruments
can
contribute
little
to
either
ultra
violet
astronomy
or
x
ray
astronomy
all
the
same
the
balloon
has
much
to
be
said
in
its
favour
since
it
can
at
least
carry
heavy
equipment
above
most
of
the
atmospheric
mass
thus
eliminating
blurring
and
unsteadiness
of
the
images
moreover
water
vapour
and
carbon
dioxide
in
the
lower
air
absorb
most
of
the
infra
red
radiations
sent
to
us
from
the
planets
balloon
ascents
overcome
this
hazard
with
ease
hot
air
balloons
date
back
to
the
year
and
within
a
few
months
of
the
first
flight
a
french
scientist
charles
went
up
two
miles
in
a
free
balloon
yet
there
is
little
resemblance
between
these
crude
vehicles
and
a
modern
scientific
balloon
which
has
by
now
become
an
important
research
tool
the
main
development
has
been
carried
out
by
m
schwarlschild
and
his
team
at
princeton
university
in
the
united
states
in
collaboration
with
the
united
states
navy
the
national
science
foundation
and
the
national
aero
nautics
and
space
administration
the
stratoscope
flights
of
concerned
mainly
with
studies
of
the
sun
were
remarkably
successful
and
the
project
hasnow
been
extended
with
stratoscope
ii
the
overall
height
from
the
telescope
to
the
top
of
the
launch
balloon
is
feet
the
balloons
together
weigh
over
two
tons
and
another
two
tons
of
ballast
are
carried
for
later
release
if
height
has
be
maintained
during
the
night
the
telescope
plus
its
controls
weighs
three
and
a
half
tons
two
large
parachutes
arc
also
carried
in
case
of
emergency
the
instruments
and
their
records
can
be
separated
from
the
main
balloon
system
and
brought
down
gently
many
of
the
radio
and
electronic
devices
used
are
similar
to
those
of
artificial
satellites
in
mediaeval
times
rivers
were
the
veins
of
the
body
politic
as
well
as
economic
boundaries
between
states
or
shires
they
were
crossed
by
fords
which
became
the
sites
of
towns
or
by
bridges
which
were
often
points
of
battle
upon
rivers
the
people
of
that
time
depended
for
food
power
and
transport
in
our
day
fish
are
caught
in
the
sea
and
brought
to
us
by
rail
and
lorry
only
the
angler
still
thinks
fresh
water
fish
important
and
pollution
of
rivers
drives
him
into
smaller
and
smaller
reaches
in
which
to
practise
his
sport
but
in
earlier
times
when
sea
fish
were
eaten
only
by
those
who
lived
on
the
sea
coast
when
meat
was
obtainable
only
for
part
of
the
year
and
when
fasts
were
frequent
and
universally
practised
river
fish
played
an
important
part
in
the
national
life
every
abbey
and
great
man
s
house
had
its
fish
pond
and
across
the
rivers
great
and
small
stretched
the
fish
weirs
usually
made
of
stakes
and
nets
or
basket
work
between
the
owners
of
the
fisheries
and
the
bargemaster
who
needed
an
unimpeded
passage
continuous
war
was
fought
till
the
importance
of
fresh
water
fish
lessened
as
the
practice
of
fasting
ceased
to
be
universal
as
meat
be
came
available
all
the
year
round
and
as
the
transport
of
sea
fish
inland
became
practicable
rivers
were
also
the
most
important
source
of
power
every
stream
had
its
mills
not
only
for
grinding
corn
but
for
all
the
other
industrial
processes
of
the
time
such
as
fulling
cloth
or
driving
the
hammers
of
ironworks
placed
down
the
bank
wherever
a
head
of
water
could
be
got
these
mills
were
to
be
found
on
the
tiny
stream
that
ran
through
a
village
or
on
the
bigger
river
that
was
also
used
for
navigation
an
artificial
cut
was
made
from
the
river
to
bring
the
water
at
proper
height
to
the
water
wheel
and
in
order
to
make
sure
of
a
supply
of
water
at
all
seasons
the
mill
owner
usually
built
a
weir
across
the
river
to
hold
back
the
water
and
so
form
an
artificial
reservoir
if
the
river
were
navigable
the
centre
of
such
a
weir
was
made
of
planks
held
vertically
by
cross
beams
so
that
they
could
be
removed
when
it
was
necessary
to
pass
a
barge
or
was
fitted
with
a
single
pair
of
gates
such
weirs
were
called
staunches
or
flash
locks
they
did
not
disappear
from
the
bigger
rivers
till
present
times
and
may
still
be
seen
in
the
fens
cleansing
and
thickening
two
main
techniques
have
been
used
for
training
elephants
which
we
may
call
respectively
the
tough
and
the
gentle
the
former
method
simply
consists
of
setting
an
elephant
to
work
and
beating
him
until
he
does
what
is
expected
of
him
apart
from
any
moral
considerations
this
is
a
stupid
method
of
training
for
it
produces
a
resentful
animal
who
at
a
later
stage
may
well
turn
man
killer
the
gentle
method
requires
more
patience
in
the
early
stages
but
produces
a
cheerful
good
tempered
elephant
who
will
give
many
years
of
loyal
service
the
first
essential
in
elephant
training
is
to
assign
to
the
animal
a
single
mahout
who
will
be
entirely
responsible
for
the
job
elephants
like
to
have
one
master
just
as
dogs
do
and
are
capable
of
a
considerable
degree
of
personal
affection
there
are
even
stories
of
half
trained
elephant
calves
who
have
refused
to
feed
and
pined
to
death
when
by
some
unavoidable
circumstance
they
have
been
deprived
of
their
own
trainer
such
extreme
cases
must
probably
be
taken
with
a
grain
of
salt
but
they
do
underline
the
general
principle
that
the
relation
ship
between
elephant
and
mahout
is
the
key
to
successful
training
the
most
economical
age
to
capture
an
elephant
for
training
is
between
fifteen
and
twenty
years
for
it
is
then
almost
ready
to
undertake
heavy
work
and
can
begin
to
earn
its
keep
straight
away
but
animals
of
this
age
do
not
easily
become
subservient
to
man
and
a
very
firm
hand
must
be
employed
in
the
early
stages
the
captive
elephant
still
roped
to
a
tree
plunges
and
screams
every
time
a
man
approaches
and
for
several
days
will
probably
refuse
all
food
through
anger
and
fear
sometimes
a
tame
elephant
is
tethered
nearby
to
give
the
wild
one
confidence
and
in
most
cases
the
captive
gradually
quietens
down
and
begins
to
accept
its
food
the
next
stage
is
to
get
the
elephant
to
the
training
establishment
a
ticklish
business
which
is
achieved
with
the
aid
of
two
tame
elephants
roped
to
the
captive
on
either
side
when
several
elephants
are
being
trained
at
one
time
it
is
customary
for
the
new
arrival
to
be
placed
between
the
stalls
of
two
captives
whose
training
is
already
well
advanced
it
is
then
left
completely
undisturbed
with
plenty
of
food
and
water
so
that
it
can
absorb
the
atmosphere
of
its
new
home
and
see
that
nothing
particularly
alarming
is
happening
to
its
companions
when
it
is
eating
normally
its
own
training
begins
the
trainer
stands
in
front
of
the
elephant
holding
a
long
stick
with
a
sharp
metal
point
two
assistants
mounted
or
tame
elephants
control
the
captive
from
either
side
while
others
rub
their
hands
over
his
skin
to
the
accompaniment
of
a
monotonous
and
soothing
chant
this
if
supposed
to
induce
pleasurable
sensations
in
the
elephant
and
its
effects
are
rein
forced
by
the
use
of
endearing
epithets
such
as
ho
my
son
or
ho
my
father
or
my
mother
according
to
the
age
and
sex
of
the
captive
the
elephant
is
not
immediately
susceptible
to
such
blandishments
however
and
usually
lashes
fiercely
with
its
trunk
in
all
directions
these
movements
are
controlled
by
the
trainer
with
the
metal
pointed
stick
and
the
trunk
eventually
becomes
so
sore
that
the
elephant
curls
it
up
and
seldom
afterwards
uses
it
for
offensive
purposes
an
earthquake
comes
like
a
thief
in
the
night
without
warning
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
invent
instruments
that
neither
slumbered
nor
slept
some
devices
were
quite
simple
one
for
instance
consisted
of
rods
of
various
lengths
and
thicknesses
which
would
stand
up
on
end
like
ninepins
when
a
shock
came
it
shook
the
rigid
table
upon
which
these
stood
if
it
were
gentle
only
the
more
unstable
rods
fell
if
it
were
severe
they
all
fell
thus
the
rods
by
falling
and
by
the
direction
in
which
they
fell
recorded
for
the
slumbering
scientist
the
strength
of
a
shock
that
was
too
weak
to
waken
him
and
the
direction
from
which
it
came
but
instruments
far
more
delicate
than
that
were
needed
if
any
really
serious
advance
was
to
be
made
the
ideal
to
be
aimed
at
was
to
devise
an
instrument
that
could
record
with
a
pen
on
paper
the
movements
of
the
ground
or
of
the
table
as
the
quake
passed
by
while
i
write
my
pen
moves
but
the
paper
keeps
still
with
practice
no
doubt
i
could
in
time
learn
to
write
by
holding
the
still
while
the
paper
moved
that
sounds
a
silly
suggestion
but
that
was
precisely
the
idea
adopted
in
some
of
the
early
instruments
seismometers
for
recording
earthquake
waves
but
when
table
penholder
and
paper
are
all
moving
how
is
it
possible
to
write
legibly
the
key
to
a
solution
of
that
problem
lay
in
an
every
day
observation
why
does
a
person
standing
in
a
bus
or
train
tend
to
fall
when
a
sudden
start
is
made
it
is
because
his
feet
move
on
but
his
head
stays
still
a
simple
experiment
will
help
us
a
little
further
tie
a
heavy
weight
at
the
end
of
a
long
piece
of
string
with
the
hand
held
high
in
the
air
hold
the
strings
so
that
the
weight
nearly
touches
the
ground
now
move
the
hand
to
and
fro
and
around
but
not
up
and
down
it
will
be
found
that
the
weight
moves
but
slightly
or
not
at
all
imagine
a
pen
attached
to
the
weight
in
such
a
way
that
its
point
rests
upon
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
floor
imagine
an
earthquake
shock
shaking
the
floor
the
paper
you
and
your
hand
in
the
midst
of
all
this
movement
the
weight
and
the
pen
would
be
still
but
as
the
paper
moved
from
side
to
side
under
the
pen
point
its
movement
would
be
recorded
in
ink
upon
its
surface
it
was
upon
this
principle
that
the
first
instruments
were
made
but
the
paper
was
wrapped
round
a
drum
which
rotated
slowly
as
long
as
all
was
still
the
pen
drew
a
straight
line
but
while
the
drum
was
being
shaken
the
line
that
the
pen
was
drawing
wriggled
from
side
to
side
the
apparatus
thus
described
however
records
only
the
horizontal
component
of
the
wave
movement
which
is
in
fact
much
more
complicated
if
we
could
actually
see
the
path
described
by
a
particle
such
as
a
sand
grain
in
the
rock
it
would
be
more
like
that
of
a
bluebottle
buzzing
round
the
room
it
would
be
up
and
down
to
and
fro
and
from
side
to
side
instruments
have
been
devised
and
can
he
so
placed
that
all
three
elements
can
be
recorded
in
different
graphs
when
the
instrument
is
situated
at
more
than
miles
from
the
earthquake
centre
the
graphic
record
shows
three
waves
arriving
one
after
the
other
at
short
intervals
the
first
records
the
arrival
of
longitudinal
vibrations
the
second
marks
the
arrival
of
transverse
vibrations
which
travel
more
slowly
and
arrive
several
minutes
after
the
first
these
two
have
travelled
through
the
earth
it
was
from
the
study
of
these
that
so
much
was
learnt
about
the
interior
of
the
earth
the
third
or
main
wave
is
the
slowest
and
has
travelled
round
the
earth
through
the
surface
rocks
the
french
foreign
legion
was
founded
by
a
royal
ordinance
written
on
a
small
piece
of
official
french
war
office
notepaper
dated
march
th
and
signed
by
the
then
reigning
monarch
of
france
louis
philippe
he
had
been
on
the
throne
for
barely
eight
months
when
he
authorized
this
measure
which
was
as
much
a
product
of
necessity
as
of
careful
planning
although
there
may
be
divided
views
on
this
the
reasons
for
forming
the
french
foreign
legion
were
probably
twofold
in
the
first
place
the
men
of
the
disbanded
royal
bodyguard
and
the
regiment
of
hohenlohe
suddenly
turned
loose
on
to
the
street
of
a
capital
seething
with
un
rest
unemployed
and
perhaps
disgruntled
at
their
abrupt
dismissal
were
a
potentially
dangerous
element
they
were
trained
to
the
use
of
arms
and
shouldthey
become
tools
of
the
politically
ambitious
or
discontented
they
would
present
a
distinct
menace
to
the
new
regime
not
yet
too
firmly
established
and
sure
of
itself
for
some
time
paris
had
been
swarming
with
countless
other
discharged
foreign
soldiers
who
had
served
in
the
french
army
at
various
times
under
the
empire
and
the
republic
many
of
whom
were
in
needy
circumstances
and
open
to
suggestion
whilst
others
were
openly
looking
for
trouble
and
always
ready
to
take
part
in
any
disturbance
it
was
clearly
both
expedient
and
desirable
to
re
move
these
dangers
as
far
away
from
the
capital
as
possible
next
the
algerian
adventure
had
begun
and
it
appeared
that
this
might
prove
expensive
in
lives
the
more
frenchmen
killed
in
north
africa
the
less
popular
the
government
at
home
would
be
so
if
foreign
cannon
fodder
was
available
so
much
the
better
the
algerian
landing
had
been
viewed
with
mixed
feelings
in
a
politically
divided
france
but
there
does
not
seem
to
have
been
any
marked
indication
on
the
part
of
the
politicians
that
they
were
unanimous
that
the
occupation
should
be
abruptly
terminated
most
were
wary
and
many
apprehensive
as
to
how
the
algerian
business
would
turn
out
the
formation
of
a
foreign
legion
seemed
therefore
to
be
an
ideal
method
of
killing
these
two
birds
with
one
stone
once
the
conditions
were
made
clear
there
does
not
seem
o
have
been
any
serious
opposition
marshal
soult
was
reputed
to
be
the
man
behind
the
scheme
both
for
removing
and
using
the
unemployed
foreign
ex
soldiers
he
could
not
have
failed
to
recognize
once
they
were
formed
into
disciplined
units
how
useful
they
would
be
both
for
garrison
duty
and
for
active
operations
in
algeria
nor
the
fact
that
if
their
casualties
were
heavy
or
their
conditions
not
of
the
best
there
would
be
no
embarrassing
reaction
for
agitation
in
france
on
their
behalf
the
royal
ordinance
decreed
that
there
should
be
a
legion
formed
foreigners
for
service
outside
france
which
was
to
be
called
the
foreign
legion
and
it
was
to
be
part
of
the
french
army
and
under
the
control
of
the
war
minister
it
laid
down
that
as
far
as
possible
companies
should
be
composed
of
men
of
the
same
nationality
or
who
spoke
a
common
language
algeria
was
not
specificall
y
mentioned
but
as
it
was
the
only
scrap
of
foreign
territory
of
any
size
possessed
by
france
at
that
moment
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
outside
france
in
the
anxiety
to
get
dubious
restless
characters
out
of
the
country
no
questions
were
asked
as
to
nationality
previous
record
or
history
and
no
proof
of
identity
was
required
the
name
and
particulars
given
by
the
recruit
were
accepted
at
face
value
and
many
gave
noms
de
guerre
for
understandable
reasons
thus
the
practice
began
and
the
tradition
started
of
asking
no
questions
this
tradition
of
guaranteeing
anonymity
began
to
develop
quickly
although
it
was
not
until
later
that
it
was
carried
to
the
extreme
of
denying
all
knowledge
of
any
individuals
who
were
in
its
ranks
and
of
refusing
point
blank
to
answer
questions
or
to
allow
any
outside
contact
with
the
legionnaires
pseudonyms
we
must
conclude
from
the
work
of
those
who
have
studied
the
origin
of
life
that
given
a
planet
only
approximately
like
our
own
life
is
almost
certain
to
start
of
all
the
planets
in
our
own
solar
system
we
arc
now
pretty
certain
the
earth
is
the
only
one
on
which
life
can
survive
mars
is
too
dry
and
poor
in
oxygen
venus
far
too
hot
and
so
is
mercury
and
the
outer
planets
have
temperatures
near
absolute
zero
and
hydrogen
dominated
atmospheres
but
other
suns
stars
as
the
astronomers
call
them
are
bound
to
have
planets
like
our
own
and
as
the
number
of
stars
in
the
universe
is
so
vast
this
possibility
becomes
virtual
certainty
there
are
one
hundred
thousand
million
stars
in
our
own
milky
way
alone
and
then
there
are
three
thousand
million
other
milky
ways
or
galaxies
in
the
universe
so
the
number
of
stars
that
we
know
exist
is
estimated
at
about
million
million
million
although
perhaps
only
per
cent
of
the
life
that
has
started
somewhere
will
develop
into
highly
complex
and
intelligent
patterns
so
vast
is
the
number
of
planets
that
intelligent
life
is
bound
to
be
a
natural
part
of
the
universe
if
then
we
are
so
certain
that
other
intelligent
life
exists
in
the
universe
why
have
we
had
no
visitors
from
outer
space
yet
first
of
all
they
may
have
come
tothis
planet
of
ours
thousands
or
millions
of
years
ago
and
found
our
then
prevailing
primitive
state
completely
uninteresting
to
their
own
advanced
knowledge
professor
ronald
bracewell
a
leading
american
radio
astronomer
argued
in
nature
that
such
a
superior
civilization
on
a
visit
to
our
own
solar
system
may
have
left
an
automatic
messenger
behind
to
await
the
possible
awakening
of
an
advanced
civilization
such
a
messenger
receiving
our
radio
and
television
signals
might
well
re
transmit
them
back
to
its
home
planet
although
what
impression
any
other
civilization
would
thus
get
from
us
is
best
left
unsaid
but
here
we
come
up
against
the
most
difficult
of
all
obstacles
to
contact
with
people
on
other
planets
the
astronomical
distances
which
separate
us
as
a
reasonable
guess
they
might
on
an
average
be
light
years
away
a
light
year
is
the
distance
which
light
travels
at
miles
per
second
in
one
year
namely
million
million
miles

waves
also
travel
at
the
speed
of
light
and
assuming
such
an
automatic
messenger
picked
up
our
first
broadcasts
of
the
s
the
message
to
its
home
planet
is
barely
halfway
there
similarly
our
own
present
primitive
chemical
rockets
though
good
enough
to
orbit
men
have
no
chance
of
transporting
us
to
the
nearest
other
star
four
light
years
away
let
alone
distances
of
tens
or
hundreds
of
light
years
fortunately
there
is
a
uniquely
rational
way
for
us
to
communicate
with
other
intelligent
beings
as
walter
sullivan
has
put
it
in
his
excellent
recent
book
we
are
not
alone
this
depends
on
the
precise
radio
frequency
of
the
cm
wavelength
or
megacycles
per
second
it
is
the
natural
frequency
of
emission
of
the
hydrogen
atoms
in
space
and
was
discovered
by
us
in
it
must
be
known
to
any
kind
of
radio
astronomer
in
the
universe
once
the
existence
of
this
wave
length
had
been
discovered
it
was
not
long
before
its
use
as
the
uniquely
recognizable
broadcasting
frequency
for
interstellar
communication
was
suggested
without
something
of
this
kind
searching
for
intelligences
on
other
planets
would
be
like
trying
to
meet
a
friend
in
london
without
a
pre
arranged
rendezvous
and
absurdly
wandering
the
streets
in
the
hope
of
a
chance
encounter
custom
has
not
been
commonly
regarded
as
a
subject
of
any
great
moment
the
inner
workings
of
our
own
brains
we
feel
to
be
uniquely
worthy
of
investigation
but
custom
have
a
way
of
thinking
is
behaviour
at
its
most
commonplace
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
the
other
way
around
traditional
custom
taken
the
world
over
is
a
mass
of
detailed
behaviour
more
astonishing
than
what
any
one
person
can
ever
evolve
in
individual
actions
no
matter
how
aberrant
yet
that
is
a
rather
trivial
aspect
of
the
matter
the
fact
of
first
rate
importance
is
the
predominant
role
that
custom
plays
in
experience
and
in
belief
and
the
very
great
varieties
it
may
manifest
no
man
ever
looks
at
the
world
with
pristine
eyes
he
sees
it
edited
by
a
definite
set
of
customs
and
institutions
and
ways
of
thinking
even
in
his
philosophical
probings
he
cannot
go
behind
these
stereotypes
his
very
concepts
of
the
true
and
the
false
will
still
have
reference
to
his
particular
traditional
customs
john
dewey
has
said
in
all
seriousness
that
the
part
played
by
custom
in
shaping
the
behaviour
of
the
individual
as
over
against
any
way
in
which
he
can
affect
traditional
custom
is
as
the
proportion
of
the
total
vocabulary
of
his
mother
tongue
over
against
those
words
of
his
own
baby
talk
that
are
taken
up
into
the
vernacular
of
his
family
when
one
seriously
studies
the
social
orders
that
have
had
the
opportunity
to
develop
autonomously
the
figure
becomes
no
more
than
an
exact
and
matter
off
fact
observation
the
life
history
of
the
individual
is
first
and
foremost
an
accommodation
to
the
patterns
and
standards
traditionally
handed
down
in
his
community
from
the
moment
of
his
birth
the
customs
into
which
he
is
born
shape
his
experience
and
behaviour
by
the
time
he
can
talk
he
is
the
little
creature
of
his
culture
and
by
the
time
he
is
grown
and
able
to
take
part
in
its
activities
its
habits
are
his
habits
its
beliefs
his
beliefs
its
impossibilities
his
impossibilities
every
child
that
is
born
into
his
group
will
share
them
with
him
and
no
child
born
into
one
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
globe
can
ever
achieve
the
thousandth
part
there
is
no
social
problem
it
is
more
incumbent
upon
us
to
understand
than
this
of
the
role
of
custom
until
we
are
intelligent
as
to
its
laws
and
varieties
the
main
complicating
facts
of
human
life
must
remain
unintelligible
the
study
of
custom
can
be
profitable
only
after
certain
preliminary
propositions
have
been
accepted
and
some
of
these
propositions
have
been
violently
opposed
in
the
first
place
any
scientific
study
requires
that
there
be
no
preferential
weighting
of
one
or
another
of
the
items
in
the
series
it
selects
for
its
consideration
in
all
the
less
controversial
fields
like
the
study
of
cacti
or
termites
or
the
nature
of
nebulae
the
necessary
method
of
study
is
to
group
the
relevant
material
and
to
take
note
of
all
possible
variant
forms
and
conditions
in
this
way
we
have
learned
all
that
we
know
of
the
laws
of
astronomy
or
of
the
habits
of
the
social
insects
let
us
say
it
is
only
in
the
study
of
man
himself
that
the
major
social
sciences
have
substituted
the
study
of
one
local
variation
that
of
western
civilization
anthropology
was
by
definition
impossible
as
long
as
these
distinctions
between
ourselves
and
the
primitive
ourselves
and
the
barbarian
ourselves
and
the
pagan
held
sway
over
people
s
minds
it
was
necessary
first
to
arrive
at
that
degree
of
sophistication
where
we
no
longer
set
our
own
belief
over
against
our
neighbour
s
superstition
it
was
necessary
to
recognize
that
these
institutions
which
are
based
on
the
same
premises
let
us
say
the
supernatural
must
be
considered
together
our
own
among
the
rest
science
and
technology
have
come
to
pervade
every
aspect
of
our
lives
and
as
a
result
society
is
changing
at
a
speed
which
is
quite
unprecedented
there
is
a
great
technological
explosion
around
us
generated
by
science
this
explosion
is
already
freeing
vast
numbers
of
people
from
their
traditional
bondage
to
nature
and
now
at
last
we
have
it
in
our
power
to
free
mankind
once
and
for
all
from
the
fear
which
is
based
on
want
now
for
the
first
time
man
can
reasonably
begin
to
think
that
life
can
be
something
more
than
a
grim
struggle
for
survival
but
even
today
in
spite
of
the
high
standard
of
living
which
has
become
general
in
the
more
fortunate
west
the
majority
of
people
in
the
world
still
spend
nearly
all
their
time
and
energy
in
a
never
ending
struggle
with
nature
to
secure
the
food
and
shelter
they
need
even
in
this
elementary
effort
millions
of
humanbeings
each
year
die
unnecessarily
and
wastefully
from
hunger
disease
or
flood
yet
in
the
west
science
and
technology
have
made
it
possible
for
us
to
have
a
plentiful
supply
of
food
produced
by
only
a
fraction
of
the
labour
that
was
necessary
even
a
few
decades
ago
in
the
united
states
for
instance
one
man
on
the
land
produces
more
than
enough
food
to
feed
fifteen
men
in
the
cities
and
in
fact
there
is
a
surplus
of
food
grown
even
by
this
small
proportion
of
theamerican
labour
force
we
have
considerably
extended
our
expectation
of
life
we
have
enriched
our
lives
by
creating
physical
mobility
through
the
motor
car
the
jet
aeroplane
and
other
means
of
mechanical
transport
and
we
have
added
to
our
intellectual
mobility
by
the
telephone
radio
and
television
not
content
with
these
advances
we
are
now
thrusting
forward
to
the
stars
and
the
conquest
o
space
no
longer
strikes
us
as
wellsian
or
jules
vernian
and
with
the
advent
of
the
new
phase
of
technology
we
call
automation
we
have
the
promise
both
of
greater
leisure
and
of
even
greater
material
and
intellectual
riches
but
this
is
not
inevitable
it
depends
on
automation
being
adequately
exploited
we
shall
need
to
apply
our
scientific
and
technological
resources
to
literally
every
aspect
of
our
society
to
our
commerce
our
industry
our
medicine
our
agriculture
our
transportation
it
is
fascinating
and
encouraging
to
observe
the
development
of
this
immense
process
a
process
in
which
man
appears
all
the
time
to
be
engaged
in
the
act
of
creating
an
extension
of
himself
in
his
new
technological
successes
this
appears
particularly
true
he
is
extending
his
eyes
with
radar
his
tongue
and
his
ear
through
telecommunication
his
muscle
and
body
structure
through
mechanization
he
extends
his
own
energies
by
the
generation
and
transmission
of
power
and
his
nervous
system
and
his
thinking
and
decision
making
faculties
through
automation
if
this
observation
is
accurate
as
i
believe
it
is
the
implications
are
far
reaching
it
might
be
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
direction
of
modern
science
and
technology
is
towards
the
creation
of
a
series
of
machine
systems
based
on
man
as
a
model
in
man
s
early
days
competition
with
other
creatures
must
have
been
critical
but
this
phase
of
our
development
is
now
finished
indeed
we
lack
practice
and
experience
nowadays
in
dealing
with
primitive
conditions
i
am
sure
that
without
modern
weapons
i
would
make
a
very
poor
show
of
disputing
the
ownership
of
a
cave
with
a
bear
and
in
this
i
do
not
think
that
i
stand
alone
the
last
creature
to
compete
with
man
was
the
mosquito
but
even
the
mosquito
has
been
subdued
by
attention
to
drainage
and
by
chemical
sprays
competition
between
ourselves
person
against
person
community
against
community
still
persists
however
and
it
is
as
fierce
as
it
ever
was
but
the
competition
of
man
against
man
is
not
the
simple
process
envisioned
in
biology
it
is
not
a
simple
competition
for
a
fixed
amount
of
food
determined
by
the
physical
environment
because
the
environment
that
determines
our
evolution
is
no
longer
essentially
physical
our
environment
is
chiefly
conditioned
by
the
things
we
believe
morocco
and
california
are
bits
of
the
earth
in
very
similar
latitudes
both
on
the
west
coasts
of
continents
with
similar
climates
and
probably
with
rather
similar
natural
resources
yet
their
present
development
is
wholly
different
not
so
much
because
of
different
people
even
but
because
of
the
different
thoughts
that
exist
in
the
minds
of
their
inhabitants
this
is
the
point
i
wish
to
emphasize
the
most
important
factor
in
our
environment
is
the
state
of
our
own
minds
it
is
well
known
that
where
the
white
man
has
invaded
a
primitive
culture
the
most
destructive
effects
have
come
not
from
physical
weapons
but
from
ideas
ideas
are
dangerous
the
holy
office
knew
this
full
well
when
it
caused
heretics
to
be
burned
in
days
gone
by
indeed
the
concept
of
free
speech
only
exists
in
our
modem
society
because
when
you
are
inside
a
community
you
are
conditioned
by
the
conventions
of
the
community
to
such
a
degree
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
conceive
of
anything
really
destructive
it
is
only
someone
looking
on
from
outside
that
can
inject
the
dangerous
thoughts
i
do
not
doubt
that
it
would
be
possible
to
inject
ideas
into
the
modern
world
that
would
utterly
destroy
us
i
would
like
to
give
you
an
example
but
fortunately
i
cannot
do
so
perhaps
it
will
suffice
to
mention
the
nuclear
bomb
imagine
the
effect
on
a
reasonably
advanced
technological
society
one
that
still
does
not
possess
the
bomb
of
making
it
aware
of
the
possibility
of
supplying
sufficient
details
to
enable
the
thing
to
be
constructed
twenty
or
thirty
pages
of
information
handed
to
any
of
the
major
world
powers
around
the
year
would
have
been
sufficient
to
change
the
course
of
world
history
it
is
a
strange
thought
but
i
believe
a
correct
one
that
twenty
or
thirty
pages
of
ideas
and
information
would
be
capable
of
turning
the
present
day
world
upside
down
or
even
destroying
it
i
have
often
tried
to
conceive
of
what
those
pages
might
contain
but
of
course
i
cannot
do
so
because
i
am
a
prisoner
of
the
present
day
world
just
as
all
of
you
are
we
cannot
think
outside
the
particular
patterns
that
our
brains
are
conditioned
to
or
to
be
more
accurate
we
can
think
only
a
very
little
way
outside
and
then
only
if
we
are
very
original
a
gifted
american
psychologist
has
said
worry
is
a
spasm
of
the
emotion
the
mind
catches
hold
of
something
and
will
not
let
it
go
it
is
useless
to
argue
with
the
mind
in
this
condition
the
stronger
the
will
the
more
futile
the
task
one
can
only
gently
insinuate
something
else
into
its
convulsive
grasp
and
if
this
something
else
is
rightly
chosen
if
it
is
really
attended
by
the
illumination
of
another
field
of
interest
gradually
and
often
quite
swiftly
the
old
undue
grip
relaxes
and
the
process
of
recuperation
and
repair
begins
the
cultivation
of
a
hobby
and
new
forms
of
interest
is
therefore
a
policy
of
first
importance
to
a
public
man
but
this
is
not
a
business
that
can
be
undertaken
in
a
day
or
swiftly
improvised
by
a
mere
command
of
the
will
the
growth
of
alternative
mental
interests
is
a
long
process
the
seeds
must
be
carefully
chosen
they
must
fall
on
good
ground
they
must
be
sedulously
tended
if
the
vivifying
fruits
are
to
be
at
hand
when
needed
to
be
really
happy
and
really
safe
one
ought
to
have
at
least
two
or
three
hobbies
and
they
must
all
be
real
it
is
no
use
starting
late
in
life
to
say
i
will
take
an
interest
in
this
or
that
such
an
attempt
only
aggravates
the
strain
of
mental
effort
a
man
may
acquire
great
knowledge
of
topics
unconnected
with
his
daily
work
and
yet
hardly
get
any
benefit
or
relief
it
is
no
use
doing
what
you
like
you
have
got
to
like
what
you
do
broadly
speaking
human
beings
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
those
who
are
toiled
to
death
those
who
are
worried
to
death
and
those
who
are
bored
to
death
it
is
no
use
offering
the
manual
labourer
tired
out
with
a
hard
week
s
sweat
and
effort
the
chance
of
playing
a
game
of
football
or
baseball
on
saturday
afternoon
it
is
no
use
inviting
the
politician
or
the
professional
or
business
man
who
has
been
working
or
worrying
about
serious
things
for
six
days
to
work
or
worry
about
trifling
things
at
the
week
end
as
for
the
unfortunate
people
who
can
command
everything
they
want
who
can
gratify
every
caprice
and
lay
their
hands
on
almost
every
object
of
desire
for
them
a
new
pleasure
a
new
excitement
is
only
an
additional
satiation
in
vain
they
rush
frantically
round
from
place
to
place
trying
to
escape
from
avenging
boredom
by
mere
clatter
and
motion
for
them
discipline
in
one
form
or
another
is
the
most
hopeful
path
it
may
also
be
said
that
rational
industrious
useful
human
beings
are
divided
into
two
classes
first
those
whose
work
is
work
and
whose
pleasure
is
pleasure
and
secondly
those
whose
work
and
pleasure
are
one
of
these
the
former
are
the
majority
they
have
their
compensations
the
long
hours
in
the
office
or
the
factory
bring
with
them
as
their
reward
not
only
the
means
of
sustenance
but
a
keen
appetite
for
pleasure
even
in
its
simplest
and
most
modest
forms
but
fortune
s
favoured
children
belong
to
the
second
class
their
life
is
a
natural
harmony
for
them
the
working
hours
are
never
long
enough
each
day
is
a
holiday
and
ordinary
holidays
when
they
come
are
grudged
as
enforced
interruptions
in
an
absorbing
vocation
yet
to
both
classes
the
need
of
an
alternative
outlook
of
a
change
of
atmosphere
of
a
diversion
of
effort
is
essential
indeed
it
may
well
be
that
those
whose
work
is
their
pleasure
are
those
who
most
need
the
means
of
banishing
it
at
intervals
from
their
minds
economy
is
one
powerful
motive
for
camping
since
after
the
initial
outlay
upon
equipment
or
through
hiring
it
the
total
expense
can
be
far
less
than
the
cost
of
hotels
but
contrary
to
a
popular
assumption
it
is
far
from
being
the
only
one
or
even
the
greatest
the
man
who
manoeuvres
carelessly
into
his
five
shillings
worth
of
space
at
one
of
europe
s
myriad
permanent
sites
may
find
himself
bumping
a
bentley
more
likely
ford
consul
will
be
hub
to
hub
with
renault
or
mercedes
but
rarely
with
bicycles
made
for
two
that
the
equipment
of
modern
camping
becomes
yearly
more
sophisticated
is
an
entertaining
paradox
for
the
cynic
a
brighter
promise
for
the
hopeful
traveler
who
has
sworn
to
get
away
from
it
all
it
also
provides
and
some
student
sociologist
might
care
to
base
his
thesis
upon
the
phenomenon
an
escape
of
another
kind
the
modern
traveller
is
often
a
man
who
dislikes
the
splendide
and
the
bellavista
not
because
he
cannot
afford
or
shuns
their
meterial
comforts
butbecause
he
is
afraid
of
them
affluent
he
may
be
but
he
is
by
no

sure
what
to
tip
the
doorman

the

master
in

he
has
little
idea
of
when
to
say
boo
to
a
maitre

from
all
such
fears
camping
releases
him
granted
a
snobbery
of
camping
itself
based
upon
equipment
and
techniques
already
exists
but
it
is
of
a
kind
that
if
he
meets
it
he
can
readily
understand
and
deal
with
there
is
no
superior
they
in
the
shape
of
managements
and
hotel
hierarchies
to
darken
his
holiday
days
to
such
motives
yet
another
must
be
added
the
contemporary
phenomenon
of
motor
car
worship
is
to
be
explained
not
least
by
the
sense
of
independence
and
freedom
that
ownership
entails
to
this
pleasure
camping
gives
an
exquisite
refinement
from
one
s
own

to
home
or
foreign
hills
or
sands

back

everything

not

are
there
outside
or
as
likely
part
of
the

idealists
have
objected
to
the
practice
of
camping
as
to
the
packaged
tour
that
the
traveller
abroad
thereby
denies
himself
the
opportunity
of
getting
to
know
the

insularity
and

containment
it
is
argued

the
opinion

not
survive

of

hotels

contrast
are
highly
cosmopolitan
granted
a

a
characteristic
that

as
yet
there
is

with

the

with

whether
the
remarkable
growth
of
organized

means
the
eventual
death
of
the
more
independent
kind
is
hard
to
say
municipalities
naturally
want
to
secure

other
custom
police
are
wary
of
itinerants
who
cannot
be
traced
to
a
recognized
camp
boundary
or
to
four
walls
but
most
probably
it
will
all
depend
upon
campers
themselves
how
many
heath
fires
they
cause
how
much
litter
they
leave
in
short
whether
or
not
they
wholly
alienate
landowners
and
those
who
live
in
the
countryside
only
good
scouting
is
likely
to
preserve
the
freedoms
so
dear
to
the
heart
of
the
eternal
boy
scout
although
truth
and
justice
may
be
the
most
powerful
impulses
to
show
moral
courage
there
are
others
compassion
is
one
of
these
tentatively
it
can
be
suggested
that
this
is
the
main
influence
upon
those
who
urge
the
abolition
of
capital
punishment
it
is
recognition
of
compassion
s
part
that
leads
the
upholders
of
capital
punishment
to
accuse
the
abolitionists
of
sentimentality
in
being
more
sorry
for
the
murderer
than
for
his
victim
this
is
nonsense
but
with
it
some
organs
of
the
popular
press
played
upon
the
emotions
of
their
readers
so
successfully
that
many
candidates
for
parliament
were
afraid
to
support
abolition
for
fear
of
losing
votes
and
the
result
was
the
muddle
headed
homicide
act
of
which
made
murder
with
robbery
a
capital
crime
and
allowed
the
poisoner
to
escape
the
gallows
that
illogical
qualification
shows
how
flimsy
is
the
argument
that
capital
punishment
is
a
deterrent
to
murder
the
poisoner
always
works
on
a
calculated
plan
of
action
and
therefore
is
able
to
consider
whether
or
not
his
taking
another
s
life
is
worth
the
risk
of
his
own
the
violent
thief
is
usually
at
the
mercy
of
an
instant
emotion
the
only
arguable
plea
for
capital
punishment
is
the
right
of
society
to
retribution
in
this
world
with
the
prospect
of
life
in
another
but
since
what
used
to
seem
to
the
great
majority
of
civilized
humanitythe
assurance
of
another
life
beyond
the
grave
has
come
to
seem
to
more
and
more
people
less
certain
a
feeling
for
the
value
of
human
life
has
become
deeper
and
more
widespread
this
may
seem
a
paradoxical
claim
to
make
at
a
time
when
mankind
is
so
much
preoccupied
with
weapons
of
destruction
nevertheless
it
is
a
claim
that
can
be
sustained
and
if
compassion
animates
those
who
urge
the
abolition
of
the
death
penalty
it
is
not
a
sentimental
compassion
for
the
mental
agony
inflicted
upon
a
condemned
man
but
a
dread
of
destroying
the
miracle
of
life
when
in
the
eighteenth
century
offences
against
the
law
that
today
would
no
earn
a
month
in
prison
were
punished
with
the
death
penalty
the
severity
of
the
penal
code
had
no
serious
effect
on
the
prevalence
of
crime
when
it
made
no
difference
to
the
fate
of
a
highwayman
whether
he
had
killed
his
victim
or
merely
robbed
him
of
a
few
pieces
of
silver
there
were
no
more
murders
then
than
there
were
when
men
like
sir
fraricis
burdett
succeeded
in
lightening
the
excessive
severity
of
the
penal
laws
in
those
days
the
sacredness
of
life
on
earth
was
not
greatly
regarded
because
a
life
in
the
world
to
come
was
taken
for
granted
except
by
a
comparatively
small
minotity
of
philosophers
nor
was
the
long
drawn
ordeal
of
the
condemned
cell
inflicted
either
upon
the
condemned
man
or
his
gaolers
once
upon
a
time
those
who
believe
in
capital
punishment
may
have
arguments
for
its
retention
but
surely
no
reasonable
argument
can
be
found
for
retention
of
the
sickening
mumbo
jumbo
that
accompanies
it
from
the
moment
that
the
judge
dons
the
black
cap
with
what
looks
like
a
pen
wiper
balanced
on
the
top
of
his
wig
to
the
reading
of
the
burial
service
over
the
condemned
man
before
he
is
dead
moreover
it
was
more
merciful
to
launch
the
condemned
man
into
eternity
twenty
four
hours
after
he
was
sentenced
than
to
keep
him
shivering
on
the
brink
of
that
dread
gulf
for
nearly
three
weeks
hanging
is
an
atrociously
archaic
way
of
killing
a
human
being
and
the
self
satisfied
modernity
of
the
electric
chair
is
just
as
atrocious
the
administration
of
a
strong
sleeping
draught
to
the
condemned
man
every
night
from
which
one
night
he
does
hot
awake
seems
a
more
civilized
alternative
to
our
present
barbarous
procedure
if
capital
punishment
through
the
influence
of
backward
minds
be
retained
